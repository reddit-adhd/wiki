# Organizing Aspects of Life

***
## Finances

* Consider moving to a *local credit union* instead of a bank.  They often have lower fees and more reasonable and understanding customer service workers.  They also often offer better rates on auto loans and such.

* *BillPay Online* with your credit union (or bank).  This keeps it all in one place, so you can check monthly totals on one site.  You also have access to all your past records, not just limited months, like some companies offer.  
  * Probably has reminders for bills.
  * Don't use individual company sites (unless you're better organized).  

* *Mint.com*  Helps plan a budget and has reminder options for bills.

* Don't use *autopay* unless you remember to check your accounts in time to move money into checking.

## Studying

### [Take Advantage of Existing Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/wiki/assistance#wiki_academic_resources)

Schools and regional governments offer various resources to people with an official ADHD diagnosis, sometimes with income restrictions.   

###How to Study (Works for all levels)

**Build structure into your studying in order to compensate for 'focusing'.**

1. *Skim* the text ahead of time; don't worry about comprehension as much as familiarizing yourself with terms and concepts.
2. As you read, use the Cornell method on your text.
3. This will let you determine specific questions; take them to your classes.
4. Afterward, re-read (at least the confusing parts), and revise/summarize your notes (using the Cornell method) as soon after class as possible.
5. Don't worry about things you don't understand (at this point) just try to understand as much of it as possible in a reasonable time; make note of your questions for study groups and office hours.
6. Read and attempt homework problems.  Don't worry about finishing each one; look them over and finish the easy ones first.
7. Take your questions and problems to study group.
8. Go back and re-attempt your homework, re-read the text (or other sources) where you're confused.
9. Go to office hours and ask any more questions you may have.
10. Go back and rework the sticky issues.  

Each of these steps should take 15-45 minutes per class per day -- this is where the [Pomodoro technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/wiki/create/habits#wiki_pomodoro_method) comes in!  (Not all steps like office hours or study groups will be *daily*.  Steps 1 & 2 and 4 & 5 should take 15-45 minutes *together* depending on how many pages have to be covered / how 'deep' the material is.  Step 3 takes no additional time beyond class-time.  All-in-all this should make your studying time more *efficient* and possibly require *less* time overall once you get in the habit.

## Cleaning

###General cleaning / upkeep:
1. Turn on happy music, open blinds and maybe windows, turn on lights. Notice and admire the improvement.  

2. Put dirty clothes in hamper or washer.  Fold and put away clean clothes.  Notice and admire the improvement.  
3. Put trash and recycling into appropriate containers.  Notice and admire the improvement.   
4. Put dirty dishes in sink.  Put away any clean dishes.  Notice and admire the improvement.  
5. Pick up and put away books and other items.  Notice and admire the improvement.  
6. Straighten your bed, couch, and other furniture.  Notice and admire the improvement.  
7. Dust, sweep, vacuum, mop, as needed.  Notice and admire the improvement.  
8. Sprinkle/spray bathroom fixtures with cleanser/spray.  Wipe mirrors and counters.  Clean sink.  Clean toilet.  Clean tub.^†  Notice and admire the improvement.  
9. Stand back and admire your work! Take a break and give yourself a small reward!

^† *Heat one cup of vinegar in the microwave and mix with one cup of undiluted liquid dish soap in a spray bottle. Spray on tub/shower and 'wipe' with a green scrubby — no actual scrubbing! =D*

### Laundry
* Mount hooks or a rod near your washer and dryer (if possible).  (A tension rod, like a shower curtain rod will work without causing physical damage if there's a narrow enough space.)  

* Keep empty hangers there.
* When your laundry is barely damp / almost dry, pull the items from the dryer and hang them immediately on a hanger, place that on the hooks/rod.
  * [Hangers for slacks, pants, and trousers](http://www.organizeit.com/images/5slackha.jpg) let you fold pants so they get a subtle crease in them, and hang several with one hook, in a space-saving manner in your closet.  
  * [Skirt hangers](http://images.containerstore.com/catalogimages/151253/4TierSkirtHgr10058165_x.jpg) are similar.
  * There are even space-saving [shirt hangers](http://www.theholdingcompany.co.uk/images/products/large/pf_MSA002.jpg) (for button-up shirts only).
* Take a batch of loaded hangers to place in the closet.
* Place boxes as "bins" in the top dresser drawer for various types of underwear, socks, etc.
  * Match socks.
  * Consider replacing all of your socks with just one type of sock, or two obviously-different types such as one dress type and one sport type, to make matching easier.
  * Other under things don't need to be folded, just sorted into the bins.  (Shoe boxes can be cut in half to make smaller bins.)
* PJs and workout clothing can be folded and placed in a drawer, as this drawer and these clothes either don't need to be as tidy or avoid wrinkling better.
* Removing clothing at the right time saves much (if not all) time you might spend ironing.
