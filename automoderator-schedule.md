        # Let's Make A Plan!

        This week's Kick Start Sunday is brought to you by the letters 'ADHD'.

        **Some advice to start with:**

        * Keep it simple and short.  We're trying to get stuff done, not have a lot to get done.

        * Prioritize your list

        * Plan some reward time for yourself when you get tasks done.

        * There are some things that you're good at off your medicine and some things you can only do on them.  If you can identify them you can plan to do them at the easiest time for you.

        ---

        **Examples from previous weeks:**

        * Order new shoes. 

        * Survive through finals.

        * Cook and eat at least two meals a day... *every* day of the week. 

        * Work on coping strategies X minutes a day.

        * Spend meaningful one on one time with each child. 

        * Get ready and *leave the house* for *any* reason.

        # Let's Celebrate Our Victories

        ADHD is a daily challenge. Sometimes it's hard to remember the positive and it can feel like things are rarely good. **We win every single day.**  We challenge you to write down your wins and see if you feel better looking at the list later in the week. Don’t worry if you miss a day or two or three! Do what you can. Even writing them down one day is a win.

        **Examples from previous weeks:**

        # Power Through One Last Thing

        Hey everyone, we're back again with one last day before the weekend. I was far less productive than I hoped but it wasn't as bad as it could have been. Like me you probably have a few things you'd like to wrap up today. So, let's all get something finished together!

        **Here's the plan:**

        - Tell us something you want to get done today. It doesn't matter how big it is as long as you can realistically get it done today.
        - Tell us how you're going to do it and when.
        - Check back in when you've done it.
        - Give yourself an ear scratch (don't deny your inner kitty). It doesn't matter how successful you were as long as you're building good habits for the future.

        ---

        **Examples from previous weeks:**

        * Go grocery shopping under budget.

        * Pay bills on time.

        * Go to a doctors appointment not only on time, or even early!

        * Finally finish re-painting my ukulele.

        * Finish two units in my foreign language workbook.

        * I have to make three phone calls to keep a project on track: a contractor, a seller, and a city official.
