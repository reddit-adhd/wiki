# ADHD Treatments  


## The Discussion  

A (good) doctor and a (good) patient will have a thorough discussion about what treatments are right for the patient given the medical history and current medications and issues.  Neither patient nor doctor should push for *just* medication as the sole treatment.  Medication is not always used, but it's *best* used *with* non-medication treatment options.  Medication isn't a magic pill, it just lowers the 'effort' barrier.  The patient still must work on skills and techniques for getting things done.  Instead of trying to learn to ride a bike uphill, medication 'flattens the ground'—learning to ride it still takes practice and energy.



## Medication and Non-Medication Treatment Options  

The benefit of using non-medication options with medication is that you can possibly take a lower dosage, and thus have less adverse effects from the medication.  

[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) is one non-medication technique.  You learn to find a planner style that works best for you and how to stop runaway or extremist negative thinking amont other things.  Here are [notes from a CBT course](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/search?q=flair%3A%27tt%27&sort=new&restrict_sr=on).  Making lifestyle changes can help maintain an even mood and energy level throughout the day.  Eating, hydrating, sleeping, and exercising routines can also have a surprising effect on the perceived efficacy of medication(s).

Non-medication treatment options work best in conjunction with medication, but if medication isn't an option for other reasons, these techniques will still help.
