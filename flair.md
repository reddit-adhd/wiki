# Subscriber Flair

### Setting Subscriber Flair
Subscriber Flair is chosen by the user in the top of the subreddit sidebar, preceded by a checkbox:

    Show my flair on this subreddit. It looks like:
    <NICK> (edit)

### Subscriber Flair Options

The options represent the following 'presentations' listed by the DSM-5:   

* ADHD-PI: Predominantly Inattentive presentation (previously ADD or ADHD-I)  
* ADHD-PH (or -H): Predominantly Hyperactive presentation
* ADHD-C: Combined presentation.  
* Other options allow one to designate relationship to someone with ADHD, such as Parent or SO, or ADHD & Parent, for example.

There is no functional difference between colored and grey flair options.



# \/r/ADHD Verified User Flair (VUF)

/r/ADHD is adopting and adapting /r/Science's system of verifying accounts for commenting. This functions similarly to the Panelist flair in /r/AskScience, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in /r/ADHD. The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic. We expect a higher level of conduct from anyone receiving flair.

### VUF Options

All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in [/r/Science's sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/).
However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...

VUF is set by the subreddit moderators after confirmation of credentials.

The general format is:

Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)

When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.


### Obtaining VUF

First, have a bachelor's degree  or higher in a field that has flair available.
Then send proof to the [mods of /r/ADHD](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FADHD).

This can be provided several ways:

1) Message the mods with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification. 

Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.

This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.


### VUF Account Expectations

We expect a higher level of conduct than a non-verified account, if another user makes inappropriate comments they should report them to the mods who will take appropriate action.
