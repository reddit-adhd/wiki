##Finland-specific process for diagnosis and medication

*(courtesy of /u/too_much_noise in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/390kcv/medication_saved_my_life/cs0zrah))*:

For me it went as follows (leaving out parts that are not pertinent to ADHD):

* Went to the doctor for an unrelated reason, and after a while he suggests i may have ADHD.
* I answered several questionnaires related to ADHD and mental disorders in general.
* After the questionnaires seemed to point toward ADHD, I had to get my mother to meet with the doctor to prove that I've had the symptoms since childhood.
* After this I had some brain scans/MRI type things done to rule out tumors or other things that could cause similar symptoms.
* Next, I had 7 sessions with a psychologist, each lasting from 1.5 to 2.5 hours. Consisted mostly of more tests, some similar to IQ tests, some general psychological tests like facial recognition, ink blot, etc.  Some of the time we would just talk.
* After the psychologist confirmed that I do seem to have ADHD (this was about 2 months later IIRC), my doctor wanted to be extra sure and sent me to a neuropsychologist specializing in ADHD, who again confirmed the findings. Now I finally had an official diagnosis.

* It's worth noting that my doctor still refused to prescribe me ADHD meds for several months even after the diagnosis, and from what I've heard it's quite common for doctors here to be extremely cautious about prescribing stimulants.
