##UK-specific diagnosis process

If you are an adult who was not diagnosed with ADHD as a child you will need to see an ADHD specialist to get a diagnosis. If you were diagnosed as a child, a reassessment must be done to confirm that symptoms remain.  If you wish to continue treatment, this may be done by a regular psychiatrist.  A GP cannot diagnose you with ADHD or prescribe medication without a diagnosis, but they can refer you to a properly qualified psychiatrist for assessment and medication recommendations. If you are using the NHS the waiting time can be anywhere up to a year depending on your area. You can also see an ADHD specialist through private coverage for a diagnosis and the waiting time will go right down to a week in many cases, however many insurance policies do not like covering ADHD so you may have to pay out of pocket.

##### UK process for diagnosis and medication 

*Please note that your experience may differ depending on the doctor and the service in your area in both with NHS and private coverage.*  [General information about medications on the Medication wiki page.](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhd/wiki/medication#wiki_the_medications)

The diagnosis process via the NHS and private insurance is often the same. You will be required to fill out questionnaires and so will your parents. You may require at least two or three sessions with a psychiatrist before a diagnosis is made.

If you are diagnosed the first line treatment on the NHS is Ritalin. If this is not tolerated, NICE guidelines suggest trying Strattera (a non-stimulant), and only moving to an amphetamine-based medication, Dexedrine, if this also does not work. The NHS does not cover Adderall. It should also be noted that no ADHD medication is licensed for treatment in adults in the UK, and while prescriptions for adult ADHD can be made off-label this can put extra liability on the prescribing doctor depending on local guidelines.

If you are diagnosed with private coverage, you have a lot more flexibility with medications. A private psychiatrist can prescribe medications not available from the NHS such as Adderall. However there are great costs associated with this - anywhere up to £600 a month should be expected due to the fact is must be imported from the US, has high import duties, and is in limited supply. If, understandably, you cannot afford that prescription, Dexedrine is a very similar drug which is covered under the NHS, and private psychiatrists are able to write to your GP in order to recommend your scrip is covered by them.  This way only pay the regular prescription charge in England, or get your prescriptions free in Scotland or Wales.  Whether your GP is happy doing this is on their discretion.

Through the private healthcare system you can get every single ADHD medication available in the US. Seeing a private ADHD specialist will cost about £250 a session with two or three sessions being normal for a diagnosis. Waiting times for private doctors is a week or two. On the NHS there is no cost, but you might have to wait a year depending on your area. You can ask your GP for local waiting times.

On the NHS you can get the following:

* methylphenidate hydrochloride IR (trade name Ritalin) and methylphenidate hydrochloride ER (trade name Concerta)
* dextroamphetamine, aka dexamfetamine (trade names Dexedrine, Dextrostat)
* lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (trade names Elvanse, Vyvanse)
* atomoxetine hydrochloride (trade name Strattera) 

No dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride IR or XR (trade name Focalin) on the NHS, but you can get it on the private system. Expect the cost to be as high as Adderall for the same reasons though. Ideally even on private healthcare you want a medication you can also get on the NHS because the cost of non-NHS medications is stupidly high.

* Book an appointment with your GP.  

* If your GP believes you show symptoms of ADHD that fit the diagnostic criteria, you will be referred to an ADHD specialist. *(This is usually accompanied by a long wait as the NHS ADHD services are very underfunded in the UK and have massive waiting lists.)*  It is important to note **GPs are not qualified to diagnose ADHD.**  
* This referral will allow you to obtain a 30 minute appointment with a psychologist who will determine if the symptoms have a significant effect on your life and if the case is worth progressing.  Bring supporting evidence that the symptoms have been present from a young age, e.g., letters from parents or flatmates, school reports, etc.  If the psychologist deems it possible, you will be given an appointment with a specialist, this is further accompanied by a long wait.  
* This specialist appointment is three hours where a series of questions and tests are used to determine if ADHD is the suitable diagnosis.  You will be given some forms to fill in prior to the appointment to bring to your assessment.  
* At the end of this appointment a decision will be made and the diagnosis is provided (providing you meet the diagnostic criteria).  
* Following this, you will have a meeting with a Specialist nurse to discuss treatments, both medication and non-medication.  
* If medication is an appropriate treatment, the nurse will arrange an appointment with a psychiatrist and a prescription is given.  
* You will have follow-up appointments with the nurse to assess your progress.
