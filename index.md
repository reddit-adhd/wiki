#ADHD Wiki

Welcome!  This is the wiki for /r/ADHD! The goal is to make something comprehensive and navigable. Feel free to contribute, either by direct edits, or by [contacting the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/adhd)! This page is designed to help those with ADHD better understand their disorder as well as provide them with useful tools and resources.

Make sure you read the [Rules and Guidelines](/r/ADHD/wiki/rulesandguidelines) for this subreddit.  [Reddit FAQs and basics can be found here.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_is_posting_personal_information_ok.3F)

## What IS ADHD?

ADHD: "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder" is a developmental disorder found in both children and adults. There has been some disagreement as to the exact cause of the disorder however it is largely thought to be a disorder of the [executive functions](http://www.lehighpsych.com/art_adhd.htm) that regulate parts of the brain. Another aspect of ADHD is [dopamine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) levels, both of which are [neurotransmitters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter). The dopamine system is part of your brain's positive reinforcement system and reward-driven learning. Calling it ADHD is more of a description of the symptoms associated with the disorder than the actual disorder. [We STRONGLY recommend that you watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li_tcua0AJI) it will help you better understand ADHD.

## ADHD is real

You will likely find someone that does not believe ADHD is a real disorder and maybe even thinks it is just unruly children or people being lazy. This is partly a consequence of the name "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder" which is nothing more than a description of the symptoms caused by the disorder rather than the disorder itself. It is very hard to help people understand [what ADHD really is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdPlyZ23ons) and what it is like to live with. You will not be able to change every person's mind, so try not to get angry or upset with people who do not understand what ADHD really is or have been misinformed their whole lives. Be patient and understanding since that is exactly what you are asking of them.

Here is an ['NIH' and 'Am J Psychiatry' published article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2365911/) on public knowledge, understanding, and stance on ADHD and medication.

Sometimes when a young adult is diagnosed with ADHD their parents/family do not understand or do not believe that ADHD is real. This can be extremely difficult and emotionally damaging. If such an situation is causing you a lot of emotional distress we ask that you see a therapist to help you cope. Also understand that your parents love you and likely just don't understand. Speak with your doctor or psychiatrist about meeting with your parents to help them understand your disorder. Also don't forget to post on the boards if you need to talk or rant, we are more than willing to listen and talk.

[This article from the University of Texas](https://web.archive.org/web/20120817151512/http://www.utexas.edu/features/2011/08/29/adhd/?AddInterest=1283) looks at ADHD from a fresh perspective.

## COMORBIDITY

ADHD patients are at high risk to have comorbid disorders such as depression, bi-polar disorder, anxiety, panic disorders, etc. It is advised you get thoroughly tested for other neurological disorders before taking medication because some medications may agitate other disorders. It is important to diagnose and treat all comorbidities in order to maximize treatment. Since comorbid conditions are associated with greater cognitive, social, and psychological impairments, early vigorous intervention is warranted.

## [Surveys and Studies](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/wiki/surveys)

We rarely approve surveys, and those we do are for research/noncommercial purposes only. If your survey meets that criteria please get back in touch with more info (including but not limited to [IRB](http://www.bard.edu/irb/consent/) approval, supervisor info, proof of association with nonprofit, etc.).

You will have to follow guidelines similar to those on /r/SampleSize, and that subreddit may be a better place for your survey.

* [Correlation is Not Causation](http://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) -- this website shows it's possible to *correlate* many things, but it's ridiculous to assume that the amount of mozzarella cheese eaten in the US actually influences the number of Civil Engineering doctorates awarded in the US.


1. Please supply at least three links to supporting evidence of Cohort Studies or higher strength evidence.

2. Do not include 'abstract only' links, or links to websites that summarize the scientific articles.  The articles must be linked directly, so readers can see the ***citations*** for themselves.  Look for and avoid ***sensationalized headlines*** and ***misinterpreted results*** that are common with media outlets that draw revenue from number of clicks.

3. Look for the source of funding and any affiliations the authors or their organizations may have.  If an author works for the company that produces the recommended medication, or if the article promoting marijuana is published in something such as "Cannabinoid Monthly," this is a ***conflict of interest.***  This is difficult to determine without the full article.

4. A study likely has ***cherry-picked results*** if no negative results, adverse effects, or other drawbacks are mentioned.  Even the most supportive studies will have *some* negative results, some drawbacks.  

5. An ***unrepresentative sample*** can be identified if, for instance, the title refers to "treatment-resistant adult ADHD" but does not specify if it's treatment-resistant due to co-morbid issues, possible misdiagnosis, etc.  It cannot be remotely assumed it will apply to anyone under 21, or the majority of patients with ADHD.  This is an unrepresentative sample.

6.  Look for the use of a ***control group*** and ***blind testing.***  For ADHD testing, a control group would be a randomly selected portion of the study participants that are given a placebo, and 'blind' testing means the participants don't know whether they're receiving the study medication or the placebo.  A 'double-blind' test is even better, where the doctors and other administrators of the study don't know which participants are receiving the study medication or the placebo.  Thus the administrators cannot even accidentally hint to the patients which pills  they're taking.  An even better option would then switch the groups and re-run the test.  The group that first had the placebo now receives the study medication, and vice versa.
