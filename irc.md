# Information
## Rules
Be nice.

In a more descriptive sense: This is a community of support and understanding.  Be supportive and understanding.  There are no rules about being ''on-topic'', but if someone comes in with a question related to ADHD during a conversation about favorite dog breeds, do your best to help them out.

Otherwise, follow the same rules as in the sidebar of the subreddit.  This includes talk of recreational drug usage, how to acquire controlled substances, and pushing of off-label usage of drugs.  If there's research into new drugs or procedures, be ready to link to '''reputable material''' on the subject and discuss it on an intelligent and polite level.

We are not doctors or psychologists/psychiatrists.  We cannot diagnose you.  However, we can share our experiences and provide advice where appropriate.

## Tips/Tricks
We have a bot, it's name is [mel-bot](/r/adhd/wiki/melbot).  It can do some pretty neat tricks like set up reminders and queue messages for offline users.

## No one's talking!
There may be several reasons for this:

* Not everyone is in the same time zone
* People with ADHD can sometimes perseverate on certain tasks and may completely ignore other things around them, including this chat room.

If you have a question or want to talk, and no one appears to be active, ask anyway!  Be patient, it may take some time for someone to notice there was any activity. 

If there's a subreddit mod on that you want to talk to, you can highlight them by saying their name in chat.  If you want to discuss the matter in private, you can send a private message with your IRC client (usually the command is `/msg sugardeath hi`) or send them a message on Reddit. 

## Why do some people have a + or an @ next to their names?
In IRC terms, this means that they have *voice* or *ops*.  This is used to allow certain users the ability to talk should the channel be muted.  When a channel is muted, those with voice and still talk, but everyone else just sits there and reads.

We have not yet used, nor do we plan on using, moderation / muting to prevent users from talking.  *We reserve the right to do so if things get out of hand, though.*  For the purposes of this channel, it is simply to distinguish the subreddit mods so that they can be easily seen if someone needs to contact them.
