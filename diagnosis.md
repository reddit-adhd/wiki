# ADHD Diagnosis

## I'm not sure if I have ADHD.

If you have a history of some of these common issues, it's worth looking into the possibility of having ADHD.

* School/job underperformance and struggles
* Chronic feelings of incompetence, guilt, and frustration
* ? Relationship issues?

Your first step is to see a doctor and go through the diagnosis process. You do not need to meet all the criteria to be diagnosed, nor does meeting any criteria mean that you have ADHD. Going to a professionally trained and impartial third party is important to figuring out what is going on.
