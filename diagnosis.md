# ADHD Diagnosis

## I'm not sure if I have ADHD.

If you have a history of some of these common issues and more (but not all!), it's worth looking into the possibility of having ADHD.

* Issues managing day-to-day tasks like paying bills and doing chores
* School/job underperformance and struggles
* Chronic feelings of incompetence, guilt, and frustration
* Relationship struggles due to issues like forgetting things or constantly interrupting your partner

## Do I need a diagnosis? I took an online test...

No online test can diagnose you. Your first step is to see a doctor and go through the diagnosis process. You do not need to meet all the criteria to be diagnosed, nor does meeting any criteria mean that you have ADHD. Going to a professionally trained and impartial third party is important to figuring out what is going on.

## What does the process look like?

*This information is heavily geared towards redditors in the US - if you are in another country please check our international guide or search the subreddit.*

There is no single yes/no test for ADHD. The process can vary depending on the doctor and obviously, you! Here are some things that are common that you can expect at least some of:

* A structured interview to talk about your life and struggles
* Questionnaires for you and sometimes close family/friends/teachers
* Symptom checklists and behavior rating scales
* Computerized tests such as the TOVA
* Life/medical history and a review of past records, if you have any
* Physical exam and testing to rule out medical causes that can mimic ADHD: sleep disorders, thyroid problems, and more
* Additional testing for prescription medications, particularly stimulants, such as EKGs for heart health, and urine analysis (both to verify if you are already taking a prescription, or to verify that you aren't abusing them already).
* Testing for other psychiatric disorders that can mimic or even co-exist with ADHD
* Additional testing depending on what is going on (e.g. EEG-based test for children and teens, or going through the diagnosis process for a co-existing concern alongside the diagnosis for ADHD)

## What type of doctor do I go to?

Look for licensed healthcare providers, ideally with expertise in diagnosing and treating ADHD with both medications and therapy. You may need to see more than one provider. Providers can be broken down into three rough categories based on the ability to diagnose, to provide therapy, and to prescribe medication.

Generally able to diagnose and to prescribe medications but not typically therapy:
* Primary care providers: internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics (MD, DO)
* Psychiatrists (MD, DO)
* Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioners (PMHNP)

Generally able to diagnose and to provide therapy but usually not able to prescribe medications:
* Psychologists (PhD, PsyD)

Generally able to provide therapy and possibly a diagnosis, but usually not able to prescribe medications:
* Clinical social workers (LCSW)

There are other providers that may be involved in the diagnosis process or with therapy, but usually not for ADHD treatment. 
* Neurologists (MD, DO)
* Neuropsychiatrists (MD, DO) and neuropsychologists (PhD)
* Pediatric neurologists, neuropsychologists, and neuropsychiatrists (MD, DO, PhD)
* Other providers in specialties that deal with ADHD-like issues, such as sleep medicine or endocrinology (MD, DO)

Specific individual providers may not be able, or willing, or experienced in diagnosis, therapy, or prescribing medications even if legally and by local practices they are allowed to do so. It is not uncommon that primary care providers will refer you to a psychiatrist for everything, or that a psychiatrist that only wants to do medication management will ask you to come back with a diagnosis from a psychologist.

These providers generally cannot diagnose or treat ADHD, although you may find them useful for lifestyle and other support:
* ADHD coaches
* Marriage and family therapists (MFT)

## How do I find a provider?

If you have insurance coverage: 

* Check if you have benefits and what they are
 * cost of office visits for mental/behavioral health/psychology/psychiatry (names and coverage may vary)
 * limits on the number of visits
 * coverage for group and individual therapy
 * covered medications
 * requirements to obtain services
* Get a list of "in network" providers to keep your cost down. See what coverage they offer for out-of-network providers too.

Then you have to make a list of providers to reach out to. Get at least one, ideally a few.

* If you already have a primary care provider, their office may be helpful in referring you. Some insurers may require you to get a referral first, either through them or through your primary care provider.
* There are sites that have lists and search of providers by type, such as Psychology Today
* Review sites may be useful, such as Yelp or HealthGrades. However, do keep in mind that a lot of the process of finding a doctor you can work with is a very personal thing.
* Local and area support groups may offer recommendations from members.
* Search for ADHD specialists. If possible, even narrow it down by child/teen vs adult vs other needs (comorbidity management, young adult, older adult, women, men, lgbtqia-friendly, etc.)

Once you have a list:

* Make sure they are appropriately licensed and affiliated. This means checking license numbers, checking for board certifications, and looking for affiliations with professional organizations (e.g. the APA).
* Contact their office to find out:
 * if they are accepting new patients
 * if you have insurance, if they take your insurance
 * even with insurance or with cash as well - ask how much the expected cost of an average diagnosis process is, and what future office visits will cost as well
 * if the provider specializes in ADHD (you can be more specific too, such as adult ADHD vs. child/teen ADHD)
 * what the provider offers in terms of diagnosis/medication/therapy, exactly. Then ask how they handle patients seeing more than one provider for the same issue (e.g. a psychiatrist for medication management and a psychologist for therapy).
 * appointment availability and scheduling options that are available
 * (if you have been previously diagnosed already) ask how the doctor handles previous/outside diagnoses and how to get your old records over to the new provider.

Rinse and repeat down the list until you find someone you can work with. Feel free to do some of the above in parallel and then make a final decision about where to book the first appointment after talking to a few offices first.

## Financial, familial, and other concerns

### I saw a provider but I don't like them/it's not working/they don't listen to me.

Unfortunately the burden is on us to advocate for ourselves. In most situations, you will be able to use your feet to seek another provider. It is _usually_ easier to switch providers after diagnosis, with documentation - enabling you to generally skip a repeat of the process with another provider. However, if you are just not happy with a provider even after one visit and barely getting started with the process, switch. There's no point in getting knee-deep into the process with a doctor you don't like. And we've also experienced and heard of doctors that don't believe in adult ADHD and more - you almost _have_ to switch to get any help!

### Can't find any specialists near me. / I can only see one provider.

Go as generalist as you need to to find someone that you can work with. A psychiatrist that specializes in depression, or your family doctor, is not automatically unable to diagnose or manage ADHD. They are not usually _ideal_ but you work with what you can get.

If your insurance is the limiting factor, then consider paying cash to see an out-of-network provider. Do keep in mind though that if you are prescribed medications, your insurance may not cover a prescription from an out-of-network doctor without additional documentation.

If you've exhausted all your local options, unfortunately, all that is left is seeking a provider out of the area or making do with what you can find on a more casual level (like, support groups and this subreddit).

### How much does it cost? / I can't afford the cost.

We cannot tell you how much a diagnosis costs. Depending on the person and the provider, it could be a single $20 office visit, or it could be a few appointments spread out over 6 months costing over $5000. Insurance also makes it super complicated.

Ask for some upfront estimates of what average visits cost at your provider. Shop around - not all providers charge the same. Make sure you compare carefully and investigate multiple avenues - some providers may seem expensive upfront but may not be. Maybe your psychologist charges a lot for diagnosis but is happy to work with your primary care doctor (and a $20 copay vs $50 for a psychiatrist) for medication management. Maybe your psychiatrist charges $150 for a single visit but they let you pick up routine prescriptions for free instead of charging for visits every time.

If you are in some specific situations, you may find more resources available to you to help defray the cost:
* Low income
* Sliding scale
* College/university/school options

### I'm underage and my parents/guardians won't help.

Advice for this situation is highly specific to the location you are in. Some areas allow for minors to seek their own medical care without the knowledge of their parents. Look for a local organization helping children/teens to find out what the situation may be for you.

Because there is always a small, very small, chance of risk when you try to advocate for your own mental health:
* Be warned that using your family's insurance coverage may mean that even if the provider cannot share information with your parents and you paid the bill upfront, your parents may still be able to see that you visited a provider.


### My partner/spouse/family has concerns / I don't know how to approach this with my adult family member(s)
