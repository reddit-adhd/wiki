# ADHD Diagnosis

## I'm not sure if I have ADHD.

If you have a history of some of these common issues and more (but not all!), it's worth looking into the possibility of having ADHD.

* Issues managing day-to-day tasks like paying bills and doing chores
* School/job underperformance and struggles
* Chronic feelings of incompetence, guilt, and frustration
* Relationship struggles due to issues like forgetting things or constantly interrupting your partner

## Do I need a diagnosis? I took an online test...

No online test can diagnose you. Your first step is to see a doctor and go through the diagnosis process. You do not need to meet all the criteria to be diagnosed, nor does meeting any criteria mean that you have ADHD. Going to a professionally trained and impartial third party is important to figuring out what is going on.

## What does the process look like?

(This information is heavily geared towards redditors in the US - if you are in another country please check _____)

There is no single yes/no test for ADHD. The process can vary depending on the doctor and obviously, you! Here are some things that are common that you can expect at least some of:

* A structured interview to talk about your life and struggles
* Questionnaires for you and sometimes close family/friends/teachers
* Symptom checklists and behavior rating scales
* Life/medical history and a review of past records, if you have any
* Physical exam and testing to rule out medical causes that can mimic ADHD: sleep disorders, thyroid problems, and more
* Testing for other psychiatric disorders that can mimic or even co-exist with ADHD
* Additional testing depending on you and your concerns (such as an EEG-based test for children and teens, or going through the diagnosis process for a co-existing concern alongside the diagnosis for ADHD)

## What type of doctor do I go to?

Look for licensed healthcare providers, ideally with expertise in diagnosing and treating ADHD with both medications and therapy. You may need to see more than one provider. Providers can be broken down into three rough categories based on the ability to diagnose, to provide therapy, and to prescribe medication.

Generally able to diagnose and to prescribe medications but not typically therapy:
* Primary care providers: internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics (MD, DO)
* Psychiatrists (MD, DO, MRCPsych)
* Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioners (PMHNP)

Generally able to diagnose and to provide therapy but usually not able to prescribe medications:
* Psychologists (PhD, PsyD)

Generally able to provide therapy and possibly a diagnosis, but usually not able to prescribe medications:
* Clinical social workers (LCSW)

Specific individual providers may not be able or willing or experienced in diagnosis, therapy, or prescribing medications even if legally and by local practices they are allowed to do so. It is not uncommon that primary care providers will refer you to a psychiatrist for everything, or that a psychiatrist that only wants to do medication management will ask you to come back with a diagnosis from a psychologist.

There are some other providers that may be involved in the diagnosis process but usually not for ADHD treatment:
* Neurologists (MD, DO)
* Neuropsychiatrists (MD, DO) and neuropsychologists (PhD)

These providers generally cannot diagnose or treat ADHD, although you may find them useful for lifestyle support:
* ADHD coaches

## How do I find a doctor?

licensing, specialties, local groups/chadd/etc., psych today's listings, referrals 

## Financial, familial, and other concerns

Can't afford it:

I'm a minor and parents won't help:

My spouse/partner concerns:

Can't find any specialists near me etc.:

Doctor doesn't believe in ADHD?

## Non-US systems
