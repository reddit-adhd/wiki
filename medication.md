# ADHD Medications  


## The Discussion  

A (good) doctor and a (good) patient will have a thorough discussion about what treatments are right for the patient given the medical history and current medications and issues.  Neither patient nor doctor should push for *just* medication as the sole treatment.  Medication is not always used, but it's *best* used *with* non-medication treatment options.  Medication isn't a magic pill, it just lowers the 'effort' barrier.  The patient still must work on skills and techniques for getting things done.  Instead of trying to learn to ride a bike uphill, medication 'flattens the ground'—learning to ride it still takes practice and energy.



## Medication and Non-Medication Treatment Options  

[Medication is the most effective treatment for the core ADHD symptoms.](https://youtu.be/o_hHNTDdgIU?t=2m22s) For the majority of people, *no* other treatment is very effective *without* also taking medication. The most common medications prescribed for ADHD, which are various formulations of amphetamines or methylphenidate, have been used for *decades* and have been shown to be very well-tolerated and safe when taken at therapeutic doses. Adverse effects are usually mild and can usually be compensated for with some tweaks to lifestyle habits.  The most common adverse effects are dry mouth, reduced appetite, and sleep issues (which tend to subside as you adjust to the medication). 

The benefit of using non-medication options with medication is that you can possibly take a lower dosage, and thus have less adverse effects from the medication.  

[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) is one non-medication technique.  You learn to find a planner style that works best for you and how to stop runaway or extremist negative thinking amont other things.  Here are [notes from a CBT course](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/search?q=flair%3A%27tt%27&sort=new&restrict_sr=on).  Making lifestyle changes can help maintain an even mood and energy level throughout the day.  Eating, hydrating, sleeping, and exercising routines can also have a surprising effect on the perceived efficacy of medication(s).

Non-medication treatment options work best in conjunction with medication, but if medication isn't an option for other reasons, these techniques will still help.

## The Process, AKA 'Titration'  

A (good) doctor will start the patient on the titration process.  Each time a new medication is prescribed, the patient will start from the doctor's 'best guess' low dosage, and slowly increase it until the side-effects are overwhelming, then back down to the next lower dosage.  It's key to maintain consistent lifestyle habits throughout this process.  An adverse effect of some medication is appetite suppression.  If you suddenly have a headache, it could be because you haven't eaten in six hours.  It is not an adverse effect of the medication however.  Another possibility is that sitting still for six hours triggered a tension headache.  This is why eating, drinking, sleeping, and exercising *well* and *frequently* enough are key.  This is also why the titration process can take weeks or months; it's necessary to monitor behaviors and medication effects over a week to confirm whether an issue is caused by the medication or not.  Take notes on when and how much you eat, sleep, drink, and excercise, as well as when you take medication(s) and summarize them for your doctor.  Don't rush to judge the new medication, just be alert and call your doctor with any questions.

### [Medication and Titration Mistakes Even Doctors Make](http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/8942.html)  

**Your doctor may have different procedures, but you can make requests about your treatment, and provide links to the science via this link.**

  1. There is no empirical evidence suggesting that any one ADHD medication will be more effective than another medication.

  2. There is no correlation between height, weight, and a patient's optimal dosage.  *(There are height/weight charts that are meant to protect growing children from being prescribed too high of a dosage.)*

  3. There is no average starting dose.

  4. There is no indication of how much a starting dosage might need to be increased, or that it will need to increased at all.  Titration speed and optimal dosage vary patient by patient, and each step can only (safely) be done after patients carefully observe any changes in their own lives, and discuss the result with their doctors.

  5. Any changes should be discussed with doctor(s) before every dosage increase.  *(Weekly via email or phone, and in-office visits at least monthly.)*  Track any changes carefully.  *(Use a [systematic rubric recorded on paper](http://www.caddra.ca/cms4/pdfs/caddraGuidelines2011WFIRS_P.pdf) or in an app.)*

  6. There is no indication how quickly improvments might be seen.  *(There are too many other variables in life -- metabolism, schedules, life emergencies, food and water intake (quantity, quality, and frequency), sleep quantity and quality, exercise intensity and frequency, etc.)*

  7. Switching from a stimulant to a non-stimulant may not alter sleep issues in ADHD patients.  *(Sleep issues might stem from medication timing, comorbid issues, or ADHD itself.)*

  8. Wean off caffeine before starting stimulants in order to more easily pinpoint the cause of any adverse effects.  *(Are jitters from caffeine, the medication, or an interaction?)*

  9. High blood pressure is not necessarily a reason to avoid stimulants.  *(Hypertension may need to be treated first, or an ADHD medication might be chosen that lowers blood pressure, prescribed alone or in conjunction with a stimulant.)*

  10. The 'novelty' of improvment in life might wear off; that doesn't mean the medication stopped working.  *(It might be a change in perception or a change in lifestyle issues, among other things.)*

### Titration Time-Frame

I wish doctors would discuss that possibility with their patients in something other than an open-ended "We'll just try things until we get it right," but it can be expected to take months in most cases.



## The Medications

The most common form of [ADHD medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#Medication) are Central Nervous System (CNS) stimulants.  There are two types or 'classes.'  There is no conclusive evidence that one medication class works better for a given subtype, though many doctors may make a claim based on anecdote compiled from their patient base.

There are [many formulations of medications for ADHD](http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/guide/adhd-medication-chart) with varying durations, common adverse effects, and interactions with other medications and medical issues.  A patient's weight is not a good indicator of the type or dosage needed to achieve good effect.

'Traditional' CNS stimulants may be eschewed if the patient has a history of heart problems or substance abuse, or if the medications would interact badly with current prescriptions. 

The **methylphenidate class**:  

* [Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexmethylphenidate) (trade names and formulations include [generic, Focalin, and Focalin XR](http://www.drugs.com/dosage/dexmethylphenidate.html))  
* [Methylphenidate hydrochloride](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) (trade names and formulations include [generic, Concerta, Metadate, Methylin, Quillivant, Daytrana, and Ritalin](http://www.drugs.com/ppa/methylphenidate-hydrochloride.html))  

The **amphetamine class**:  

* [Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisdexamfetamine) (trade names and formulations include [generic and Vyvanse, which is sold outside the US as Elvanse, Venvanse, or Tyvense.](http://www.drugs.com/ppa/lisdexamfetamine-dimesylate.html))   
* [Mixed amphetamine salts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall) (trade names and formulations include [generic](http://www.drugs.com/pro/dextroamphetamine-saccharate-amphetamine-aspartate-dextroamphetamine-sulfate-amphetamine-sulfate.html) and [Adderall](http://www.drugs.com/pro/adderall.html))  
* [Dextroamphetamine sulfate, aka dexamfetamine sulfate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine) (trade names and formulations include [generic](http://www.drugs.com/cdi/dextroamphetamine.html), [Dextrostat](http://www.drugs.com/mtm/dextrostat.html), and [Dexedrine](http://www.drugs.com/dosage/dexedrine.html).)

**Other medication options** are sometimes preferred as the first medication attempted for treating ADHD if the patient as has primary or comorbid depression or anxiety, has insomnia, migraines, tics, or wishes to stop smoking, among other condistions..

* [Atomoxetine hydrochloride](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomoxetine) (trade names include generic and Strattera)  
* [Bupropion hydrochloride](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion) (trade names include generic, Wellbutrin and Zyban)   
* [Guanfacine hydrochloride](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanfacine) (trade names include generic, Estulic, Tenex, and Intuiv)   
* [Clonidine hydrochloride](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonidine) (trade names include generic, Catapres, Kapvay, Nexiclon, and Clophelin)  

**[Time-Release Technology Abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_release_technology)** -- CD, CR, DR, ER, IR, LA, MR, SA, SR, TR, XL, XR, XT.

Both the positive and negative effects of these drugs will vary greatly from person to person as they are dependent on your own chemical biology. Most minor side effects such as dry mouth or appetite loss will decrease or completely go away with extended use, however you should still let your doctor know about these side effects and how severe they are. If you are experiencing strange unlisted symptoms or more serious side effects such as bloody stool please call your doctor IMMEDIATELY, do not stop and take a picture for reddit karma.



### A Note on Medications  

Keep in mind that if you try a medication like methylphenidate IR (brand name Ritalin), methlyphenidate XR (brand name Concerta), or dexmethylphenidates IR and XR (brand name Focalin IR and XR), they can have totally different effects on the same person.  Unless you have a true allergy or your doctor indicates otherwise, don't totally discount all in the methylphenidate class because you didn't like just one of them.  The same goes for all the medications in the amphetamine class.  



### Common Adverse Effects (Side-effects)^†  

Medication isn't black and white; they affect each individual differently, so you can't compare experiences one-to-one.  Your best bet is to discuss it with trained professionals, i.e. your doctor, and not a bunch of random internet strangers.  It's common for people with ADHD to have other psychological and medical issues -- no two patients are going to have the same combinations of issues, diet, biochemistry, and medications, so anything found on the internet (including the people in discussion forums) is either statistical averages or anecdotes.  "I drank a glass of water and fell out of a plane" is an anecdote.  These two things happened, but one did not *cause* the other, and you don't know all the parameters of the situation.  Did the person jump out with a parachute?  Were they pushed?  Did they trip while exiting a demonstration cockpit on the ground?

### Questions About Dosage or Side-Effects?^†  

**Read the label** on the medication bottle and **read the medication guide** the pharmacist gave you with the filled prescription.  If that doesn't clarify how you're supposed to take it, **talk to your doctor**!  You can call the doctor's office and leave a message with a nurse who will speak with the doctor and return your call with the information you need.  If it's outside office hours, **call or visit your pharmacy** and ask for clarification from a pharmacist.  



### How much does medication cost?^†  

* There are some [assistance programs detailed in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/wiki/assistance) that may help with medical and prescription costs, depending on your location, income, etc.

* [goodrx.com](http://www.goodrx.com/) can help you locate the best pharmacy prices in your area.  They also offer links to assistance programs, discount cards, and information about alternatives and generics.

* [ConsumerReportsHealth.org: Best Buy Drugs](http://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/best-buy-drugs/ADHDFinal.pdf) is a PDF download that should help you out (unfortunately, the link changes occasionally so use google if it's broken, and [let us know](/message/compose/?to=/r/adhd)).



### Which medication is best?^†  

This will vary greatly for each patient and is a question best answered by your doctor. ADHD medication is largely trial and error so you will need to work with your doctor to find the medication best suited for you. [Here is a PDF from Consumer Reports Health comparing ADHD medication](http://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/best-buy-drugs/ADHDFinal.pdf)

If you felt like a ‘zombie’, your medication is probably not the right drug or "dosage" for "you".  Finding the right medication is a process of trial and error as all meds seem to work differently for each patient, and is best done through open discussion with your doctor.

I was afraid ADHD medication would zombify me, so I avoided it for years -- in retrospect I think of all the angst I would not have suffered over the years. The only part of my personality that has changed are the negative aspects: I'm less socially anxious and awkward.  I don't interrupt as much and I'm more aware of it when I do.  I don't panic that there was some implied snide meaning behind a casual comment or joke.

### An example titration process for ADHD medicine.  

* My first doctor first put me on Strattera 'because it was a non-stimulant'.  Worst. Experience. Of. My. Life.  Then I got lucky with Concerta, an extended-release (XR) form of the ingredient of Ritalin.  18mg did nothing, but 27mg did, so we stopped there.  I was off and on Concerta as I could get it over a few years, and always felt like I would do okay the first week or two off of it.  Then life would crash down around me. 

(I never felt the 'high' some patients speak of when I went back on my medication.  It just made me feel somehow 'normal' and like life was much easier; I could easily be productive without being detrimentally anxious about the infinity of things I had to do.)

* My newest doctor (after a couple of geographical moves) put me on Ritalin while I waited for re-approval from the patient assistance program for Concerta.  Ritalin was better than nothing, but just "bumpy." I never did have a chance to try physically splitting the pills in half and taking half of one every two hours--this would mimic the XR release pattern better. 

* Adderall IR was better because it's a mix of ingredients that have different half-lives, so less 'bumpy'.

* Now I'm back on Concerta; I've been bumped to 36mg and now 45mg.  Recently I've learned that's still technically a "child's dose", but I'm starting to wonder if I'm getting side effects, so I'm not sure if I want to go to 54mg. 

(The 'side effects' could also be manifestations of grief, of being a grad student, or comorbidities like anxiety or depression, so I'm doing counseling to rule out some of the possibilities.  I ''do'' think I want to change and get someone who has ADHD as I don't feel understood when I'm trying to describe how I feel misunderstood.)  =P

* I was accepted to the patient assistance program for Focalin XR, so I tried that next, at the suggestion of my ADHD cousin who is a pediatric OD--she prefers it over the racemic form in Concerta.  Some believe that levo-methylphenidate contributes more of the adverse effects and dextro-methylphenidate provides most of the therapeutic effect.  I'm not sure I can tell the difference between the two.

* With the prices of Adderall (IR and XR) I will likely not try them (grad student; no prescription coverage), but I may try Vyvanse, or other medications as well, ''just to find the'' '''best''' one.

Each time I try a different medication, I will have to ''titrate'' it, that is, start from the doctor's 'best guess' low dosage, and slowly increase it until I feel the side-effects are overwhelming, then back down to the next lower dosage.

* TL;DR:  You will have to try many different medications in a range of various dosages to find the ''best'' ADHD drug ''for you''.
* Also,
  * *Medication is not a 'magic pill' --* you will still have to work on adaptation skills and abilities, or 'behavioral modification.'
  * *You can potentiate lower doses of medications by drinking sufficient water, eating ''enough'' of 'clean' whole/natural foods and avoiding processed ones, exercising regularly, and maintaining a regular sleep schedule.*


***
### Tolerance  

Tolerance is unlikely to be an issue at therapeutic dosages.  It's really only an issue for those abusing the medication or who are 'chasing the rush'.

**For the rest of us, tolerance is a perception that a stimulant medication becomes less effective after long-term use.**

From what I've heard (from my doctor) there's not much chance of an actual 'tolerance.'

My conjecture is that it's more a change in the patient's perception:

* Before medication your 'average' day feels like a 2/10, for example.  Your first few days on *the right* medication feel like an 6/10 in comparison.  This is a 4 point increase, or a 300% increase from your 'average'.

* After you've been on your medication for a while, you start thinking your average day is a 6/10, and after you start realizing how much more you can get done, you raise your expectations of what a 10/10 would be like.  So now, your 'good' days that you think are 'due to being medicated' only seem like a 8/10, which is 'only' a 33% percent increase. 

Since people with ADHD tend to have unrealistically high expectations for themselves, they might feel bad that they're no longer experiencing that '300% increase'.

**A better measure would be to realize that "100%" is superhuman, or impossible/unrealistic.  The pre-medicated state was 20% (which made ''me'' feel like 'slime').  The newly medicated state was 60%, or about average/realistic.  An 80% state is phenomenally good day, well above average or "reasonably to be expected."**
