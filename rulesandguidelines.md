Note that this page should not be considered a complete list of rules. Moderators will remove any post, at their discretion, that they feel is against the rules or does not belong on /r/adhd. The rules should also be considered fluid as our interpretation of them may change over time. Finally, *no rules lawyering*.

## /r/ADHD posting rules!

1. **[Read the FAQ](/r/ADHD/wiki) and [search /r/adhd](/r/ADHD/search?q=adhd+keywords&restrict_sr=on)** before posting!

2. **Use a specific title, keep posts brief, and avoid asking "DAE..."** We've all been there and done that. Spend a minute to write a specific question for your title. Short paragraphs, bold text, and bullet points are good. Aim for 1-2 sentence tl;drs.

3. **Avoid asking if you should get diagnosed or if something is a medication side effect.** If in doubt, asking your doctor or pharmacist should take precedence over what internet laypeople have to say.

4. **Memes and media content must be part of a greater discussion.** Take fluff and #justadhdthings to /r/adhdmeme. We have enough distractions here!
    
5. **Studies, AMAs, Q&A, and similar from healthcare providers and researchers require prior mod approval.** Please review [our policy on studies and more](https://reddit.com/r/adhd/wiki/surveys) and if applicable [please message the mods.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FADHD)

## Community guidelines

* **Report posts and comments that violate rules.** The mods thank you <3

* **Be civil.** Name-calling is the fastest way to gain a break from r/adhd.

* **A word on medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.** Always talk to your doctors! This includes your pharmacist if you have a medication question. We try to do our best, but no warranty whatsoever is made that the information provided here is accurate or relevant.

* **No discussion of recreational use and abuse of drugs.** This includes taking more medication than prescribed, and taking medications that are not known to treat ADHD.

* **No conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and alternative medicine.** This is not the subreddit to debate if ADHD is real. This is also not the subreddit to talk about things like homeopathy for ADHD, that ADHD is a positive adaptation from the hunter-gatherer days, etc.

* **No advertising.** Not even "free" items. Offending posts will be removed and the posters banned.
