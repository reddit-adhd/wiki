## /r/ADHD posting rules!

1. **[Read the FAQ](/r/ADHD/wiki)** at least once before posting! If something is missing you can [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FADHD) to notify us or request permissions to help expand the wiki.

2. **[Search /r/adhd](/r/ADHD/search?q=adhd+keywords&restrict_sr=on) for previous posts** on the topic ([search via google](http://www.google.com/search?q=site:reddit.com%2Fr%2Fadhd+adderall)).  

3. **Use a specific, meaningful title.**  Incomplete or vague post titles will be removed.^(If it's reported!) *(‘Has anyone felt this?’ ‘First day on Adderall’)*   **Do not title your post with DAE.** People with ADHD always have.  Ask a specific question in the title and ask at least two specific questions in your post. There is *ALWAYS* space.

4. **If possible, keep posts brief.  If not possible, break it up.**  Use short paragraphs, bold text, numbers, and/or bullet points for longer posts, and include a one or two sentence TL;DR summary.

5. **Meme/comic/picture/video** - With a visual post, use a descriptive title, and preferably also include a comment asking a question for discussion or share your own experience... Pure memes (including anything with a 'hash-tag' such as #justadhdthings) should be posted in /r/adhdmeme and will be removed from here.

6. **No posts asking about drug side effects** - Search google or ask in the weekly question thread. (Reasoning in upcoming posting FAQ.)  
    
7. **AMA’s and surveys require prior mod approval.**

8. **We cannot and will not diagnose.**  We are not doctors and you should not trust internet people with something so important.  If you suspect you might have ADHD, please consult a trained professional.  A psychiatrist or ADHD specialist will be able to help you out.

9. **Not sure if you should seek diagnosis?**  Go seek diagnosis.
