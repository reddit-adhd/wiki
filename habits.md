## General Tips, Tricks, & Techniques

***
### [Pomodoro Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

There are five basic steps to implementing the technique:

* **Decide on the task** to be done.  *(This can be a measurable component of task, such as 'unload dishwasher' instead of 'clean kitchen.)*  

* **Set the pomodoro timer to *n* minutes** (traditionally 25).  *(This can start as low as 5 minutes, and can be built up to 45 minutes.)*  
* **Work until the timer rings; record with an *x*.**  
* **Take a short break** (3–5 minutes).  *(This can be as long as 15 minutes after a 45 minute pomodoro.)*  
* **After four pomodori, take a longer break** (15–30 minutes).  *(If doing longer pomodori, the longer break can be up to 1-2 hours, for a meal or running errands, which is really just switching to a different set of tasks.)*  =)

**Apps**  

* Hours, free, (iOS, maybe others).  **Under review.**

* PomodoroTempo, free (iOS, maybe others).  
  * Variable work sessions.  *Can be set too long.*  
  * Allows pomodoro to be paused.
  * Unsure if it automatically times breaks.  
  * Unsure if it tracks number of completed pomodori.
  * *No option to change icking and time's-up sounds.*

* PomodoroLE, free (iOS, maybe others).  
  * *Only allows standard 25 minute work session.*  
  * Allows pomodoro to be paused.
  * Unsure if it automatically times breaks.  
  * Tracks total number of pomodoros.
  * *No option to change icking and time's-up sounds.*

### Time Chunks + To Do Lists

* **Block out a time** (like 30 minutes) for 'chores'.  

* **Have a relevant To-Do list.**  ('Chores' list: sweeping, mopping, putting things away, ....)  

* **Set a timer** and work on the list for that amount of time.  

* **Use '30 Minutes on Chores' as a task for today** -- it's not necessary to set a specific time to start it.

This way you avoid having to analyze how long sweeping the floor will take (say you estimate 5 minutes) and scheduling that for 8:30-8:35, at which point you realize that you forgot to account for picking things up off the floor and putting them away, etc.  You will also spend less time trying to create the 'perfect' schedule, or having to rearrange your schedule every time you get a *little* off track.

### Time Cracks + To Do Lists

* **Have To-Do lists with short tasks.**  

* **Use those 5 minutes while waiting** in line, at the doctor's office, or on metro transit to make a call, write an email on your phone, or even update your to do list(s).  (Be respectful of others, and don't make phone calls when other people are present.)
* **Make phone calls while driving.** (If it's 'easy' driving, not heavy traffic or while navigating to a new location.  Use your common sense.  If driving is too hard for you to focus on, don't do this.)  Using a hands-free setup for your phone (where legal), you can call a friend or family member to catch up.  Avoid calls where you will have to schedule appointments or otherwise handle your phone.
