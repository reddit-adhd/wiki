####How much are psychiatric sessions?^†
-------------------
This will be completely dependent on your region and can be any where from (-)$90-$300(+) each session. **My personal experience** was $230 for the first session which was an hour long and $90 for each session afterwards which was 30 minutes long. To start figuring out how you might be spending to see a psychiatrist you should either speak with your doctor about local practices or use Google to search your local area and call a few offices asking about the price of sessions. Do not be discouraged by the price information here, please go and look at your local area.  
  


####Will my insurance cover my medication and/or psychiatric sessions?^†
-------------------
This is a question you need to take to your insurance company, please call and ask them. We do not work for your insurance company and therefore do not know.
