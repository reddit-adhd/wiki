## [**Chipotle Hummus**](http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/classic_hummus.html)  

######Ingredients

* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed  
* 2 T ea lemon juice, toasted sesame seeds
* 2.5 t sesame oil
* 1.5 T extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/4 t chipotle powder
* 1/2 t salt

######Directions

With the motor running, drop garlic, toasted sesame seeds, sesame oil, lemon juice, and salt through the feed tube of a food processor fitted with a steel blade attachment; process until puréed. Scrape down the sides of the workbowl and add chickpeas and chipotle powder. Process and stream in the olive oil slowly, just enough until it's completely smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary, 1 to 2 minutes.

You could use chipotle sauce or canned chipotles too.  

I use 2.5 t. sesame oil + 2 T. toasted sesame seeds, since I can't find a tahini that doesn't taste like paste.

I *loathe* garbanzos/chick peas, but I *adore* this hummus!  =)

## [**Chicken Fajita Nachos with homemade pico de gallo**, and 2% Greek yogurt (tastes just like sour cream)](http://i.imgur.com/aPth5yi.jpg)  

Chicken Fajita Nachos -- 1/2 lb. chicken breast, 1 orange bell pepper, homemade pico de gallo (with 1/2 lb. tomatoes), and 2% Greek yogurt (tastes just like sour cream).   

## Cottage cheese, lemon zest, cayenne pepper, and black pepper.
  Blend --> Fantastic, healthy veggie dip!

## 'Refried' Black beans
  sauteed with garlic & onions and squeeze in some lime juice. Top with minced cilantro and feta (or crumbly mexican cheese).

## **[Sea-salted Dark Chocolate Caramel "KIND" Bar](http://www.theyummylife.com/recipes/324)** 

I used brown sugar in place of the honey, for the 'caramel' taste. =D I also add vanilla and orange extracts, espresso powder, a hint of cinnamon and cayenne to the chocolate to create complexity.
