***DIY Smoothie Packs included.***

##[Overnight No-Cook Gourmet Oatmeals](/r/ADHD/wiki/oatmeals)

## My first/fastest breakfast snack: almond butter on whole-grain, seeded toast, tea, and yogurt.

## [Gingerbread healthy breakfast muffins!](http://www.theyummylife.com/magic_muffins)
Several other flavors; can be Healthy Breakfast Bread Pudding, too.

## **[Gourmet Breakfast Sandwich in MINUTES](http://imgur.com/a/wVjuZ#12)**   
Half egg-white 2-egg scramble with a smashed mushroom, snipped green onion, a handful of frozen chopped spinach, shaved cheese (veggie peeler makes this fast), a sprinkle of nutmeg and black pepper and a splash of whole milk.   

Whip with a fork in a buttered oversized bowl, and microwave 1-2 minutes at a time, stirring in between.   

(Skip the last stir if you want an "omelet" to put between two slices of whole-grain, seeded bread for a sandwich on the run.)

## [Bread Pudding French Toast](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/french-toast-recipe/index.html)
 
* Whole, multi-grain, seeded (high-protein) bread  
* Maple syrup or brown sugar, not honey   
* 1/2-1 egg/slice (sub 1/2 egg whites)   
* Reduce to 2T. whole milk or 1/2-n-1/2   
* Add vanilla extract, orange extract, orange zest, cinnamon, and nutmeg to taste

  Cook like regular French toast.

## [Oatmeal Pancakes](http://www.bobsredmill.com/recipes_detail.php?rid=236)
  Sub. butter & brown sugar instead of oil & white sugar.  
  Add toasted almonds, pecans, or hazelnuts and blueberries or minced turkish apricots.  
  Serve with wedges of fruit for "gourmet touch".  

##[**Cornmeal Buttermilk Waffles**](http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/whole_grain_waffles_cherry_sauce.html)
I often 'make' buttermilk by adding 1T. lemon juice to 1c. 2% Greek yogurt (milk also works).  Let it sit to curdle.

I've not tried the cherry sauce, and I've used heritage grains (whole) white (soft wheat) AP flour or spelt flour in place of the whole wheat for tasty results.

I also add Saigon cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg (and orange extract depending on what I'm topping them with).  More flavor means you can add less fat and salt!  =D

**I usually double or triple the recipe and make extras to freeze** in a ziploc separated by parchment paper (after they've cooled).
