## Surveys and Studies

We rarely approve surveys, and those we do are for research/noncommercial purposes only. If your survey meets that criteria please modmail us with more info including but not limited to:

* [IRB](http://www.bard.edu/irb/consent/) approval

* supervisor info

* proof of association with nonprofit

* etc.

You will have to follow guidelines similar to those on /r/SampleSize, and that subreddit may be a better place for your survey.

This community is welcoming; hate speech and abusiveness will never be tolerated. Offenders will be banned at the discretion of the mods. 

##**Guidelines for Surveys and Studies**

###Titles must be properly formatted.

> **[Tag] Topic (Demographic)**  

> If your title doesn't match up with the guidelines it will be removed.

>> Here are some examples:

>> * [Approved Academic Survey] Study Habits (US HS)
* [Approved Academic Survey] Bedtime Habits (Europe University)
* [Approved Survey Results] Handedness (Worldwide 6-18)

>> Here are the pieces of the title:

>> **[Tag]** [Approved Academic Survey] for surveys. [Approved Survey Results] for posts sharing the results of a previously posted survey. Choose only one tag.

>> **Topic** - Topic of your survey ("survey for my english class" is **not** an adequate description)  .

>> **(Demographic)** - Who you want to answer your survey; age, country, characteristics, etc. Let potential respondents know whether they should participate (required even if your survey is open to everybody). 

>>  If you're confused about the rules, [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FADHD) and ask questions!

### Reposting

> Please feel free to repost your survey ***after*** 24 hours have passed, AND it has fallen off of the front page.

>> Please add **[Repost]** to your original title to prevent getting duplicate respondents. It'll look like this:

>> **[Repost][Approved Academic Survey] Handedness (Worldwide 6-18)**  

>> If you repost when your survey is still on the front page, or within 24 hours of your last post, it will be removed. Please remember to repost within reason.

###Gender / Sex

> When asking about gender or sex, **include "another gender" and/or a "fill in the blank" option** if your demographic is for (Everyone). 

>> This helps with data integrity, and it also helps with inclusion. More people than you might think would fill out "other" on a gender question! If you are strictly interested in only people who identify as Male or Female, make sure you use (M/F) in your demographic.

### Race / Ethnicity

> If you are asking about **race and/or ethnicity** in your survey, please know [the differences between them](http://web.archive.org/web/20151028182449/http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/reic/definitions.asp). 

>> Race refers to physical characteristics that one shares with other people of one's race, while ethnicity refers to one's culture and traditions. If you mix these up, you once again may run into data integrity issues!

### Ethical implications and consent

> Don't forget to consider [ethical implications and consent](http://inside.bard.edu/irb/consent/) for your research.

>> If you require signed consent from a moderator before posting your survey, feel free to [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FADHD) and we would be happy to help you out.

### Commenting and Behavior

> Please refrain from soliciting participants in the comments section of other surveys.  Your survey permission will be rescinded and you may be banned from the subreddit if you do so.

>> The discussion section for each thread is for comments about that survey. If you see people doing this, feel free to report the comment, and we'll remove it and talk to them about it.

##**Flair for Posts**

You can tag your surveys and then people can search for them!

####[Approved Academic Surveys and Results](/r/SampleSize/search?q=flair:'Survey'&restrict_sr=on&sort=new)

Everybody likes to see survey results! If you are able to post the results of your survey, please use a **[Approved Survey Results]** tag on that post, and please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FADHD) so we can approve and flair your results. 

##**Resources**

### Self Post vs. Survey

> Post your survey using a survey tool instead of merely asking a question in a text-only post. People are more likely to respond!
