Add extra stock or water if the soup is too thick. Break up the potato with a fork or use a potato masher to achieve a texture that suits you. Season with salt and pepper.

**Southwestern Potato-Cheddar Soup**  
For a Southwestern version of this soup, use cilantro instead of chives, and add 1 (4-ounce) can chopped roasted green chiles, 1/4 c. cilantro, and 1 whole serrano chile.  Serve with frozen roasted corn, thawed.

## [**Roasted Pumpkin-Apple Soup**](http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/pumpkin_apple_soup.html)
I add an equal amount of celery, ~1T. maple syrup, use 1 c. pumpkin ale or fall white wine, and toast pecans with paprika, chipotle powder, salt, and pepper.  Basically I just added anything thing that made it more Fall/Winter-like, but in reasonable quantities. I serve it with 2% Greek yogurt as sour cream or puréed in to make a cream soup, and sprinkle with the chopped seasoned nuts. (Hazelnuts or pecans work equally well, and it works fine without nut oil.)
