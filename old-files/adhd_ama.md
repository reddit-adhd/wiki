# ADHD AMA Rules and Guidelines

## What is an AMA on /r/ADHD?

An AMA is an vetted ADHD specialist, invited to discuss their specialty with our community.  "IAmA" is the traditional way of beginning the description of who you are; "AMA" is the traditional way of ending the description; the acronym means "Ask me anything."   The process begins by the moderators contacting an exper and the expert providing proof (details below).  The confirmed interviewee will have a special flair indicating they've passed the verification process.  The AMA begins when the expert starts a post, describing who they are and what they do. Then, commenters leave questions and can vote on other questions according to which they would like to see answered. The interviewee then goes through and responds to any questions that he or she would like, and in any way that he or she prefers.

I think we need to follow (and adapt) this in a summary for this page, which we can then allow the public to see when it's finalized.

### Maybe ask /r/Science mods for help?
Either the setting up or the verification or all of the above.
