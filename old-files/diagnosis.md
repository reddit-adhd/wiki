# ADHD Diagnosis
## Do I have ADHD?  How Do I Know, aka, What's the Process for Getting a Diagnosis?

You will have to discuss this with one or more doctors.  While we enjoy helping people out and answering questions we can not diagnose you and neither can you diagnose yourself. [MSU created this page](https://www.msu.edu/course/cep/888/ADHD%20files/DSM-IV.htm) for psychology students; it will help you understand the common criteria and the ADHD sub-types. '''Matching the criteria does NOT mean you have ADHD''', it is only meant to help you decide whether to see a professional or not so that you don't have to make a post asking us. Another useful resource is the [ADHD Tool Box](http://totallyadd.com/tools/) from 'TotallyADD.com', it has a "virtual doctor" video as well as downloadable and article sources.

That said, the best advice is to ***TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR!***  *(As a rule, avoid online tests and otherwise predisposing yourself to sounding like you've diagnosed yourself.)*

### What Type of Doctor Can Diagnose, Treat, and Prescribe?
* Talk to your GP/PCP and your insurance company to find out what types of doctors and services are covered, and what type of doctor is required for a diagnosis.  You can also get a referral from either of these sources.
* [ADDitude Magazine's *Who Can Diagnose ADHD?*](http://www.additudemag.com/adhd-web/article/565.html) 
* [CHADD's National Resource Center on ADHD *Professionals Who Diagnose and Treat ADHD.*](http://www.help4adhd.org/en/treatment/prof) 

  * An official **diagnosis** can **only** be done by a **psychiatrist or psychologist** (depending on location, insurance company, and other requirements).
  * A **'psych'** may refer **either to a psychiastrist or a psychologist.**  In either case, the best bet is to **find an ADHD specialist.**  
  * **[General Pracitioner/Physician (GP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner)** and **Primary Care Physician/Provider (PCP)** are both terms for a **'regular doctor'** or a **'family doctor'**.  (There may other terms used in different locations or with different insurance companies and medical groups.)  Depending on location and doctor preference, a GP *may* be *able* to prescribe ADHD medications, but *may* choose not to.  Some may prefer to defer to psychiatrists completely, while others may be willing to prescribe *once a patient's optimal medication and dosage has been determined by a psychiastrist*.  Often this is because GPs understand that psych visits may not be covered by insurance.
  * A **psychiatrist** can **prescribe**.  A **psychologist cannot.**
  * A **psycholigist may be better trained in non-medications treatements, such as CBT or talk-therapy.**  They may also be less expensive than psychiatrists.
  * Beware of (and do research to avoid) lesser-trained 'professionals' who offer 'ADHD therapy' with little or no medical or psychiatric training.  Many of these do so at 'discounted rates' (compared to trained professionals), either in person or online.
  * Beware that some medical professionals don't believe that Adult ADHD exists or that ADHD exists.


###Find a Doctor
***(This process should work regardless of country or region.  Some links are location-specific.)***  

  1. Get a file folder.  You will be given physical papers at some point in this process.  

  2. Label it "ADHD Diagnosis/Psych" or something meaningful.  
  3. *Attach* a blank sheet of paper to the inside for your To Do List.  *(Staple or tape this in.)*
  4. Clip extra paperclips to the edge of the file folder for when you don't have a stapler with you.  Use these to clip papers to the file folder so they cannot fall out.
  5. Date items when you did them and make notes, e.g. "Called Dr. A's office.  No answer.  Left Voicemail. 20.Feb.2015, 2:30 pm."  
  6. Make a *new* To Do item if you need to call them again.
  7. Get a referral from your General Practitioner or your Primary Care Provider.  (This may not be required by your insurance or regional laws, but it can make the process of obtaining a psychiatrist or psychologist easier.)  *Make sure to ask for one who specializes in (Adult) ADHD (Diagnoses).*  You might be able to do this with a phone call or you may need to make an appointment.  This may result in a physical hard copy (a piece of paper) that you must take to your next doctor.  
  8. Get a list from your insurance company.  (Hopefully they have one that's limited to the doctors currently accepting new patients.)  *Make sure to ask for one who specializes in (Adult) ADHD (Diagnoses).*  You might be able to find a list online, or you might have to call them.  Surprisingly my insurance company's customer service is friendly, patient, and helpful, whereas their 'Find a Provider' page is almost impossible to read.  
  9. If your insurance isn't helpful, find a psychiatrist/psychologist in your area via online resources.   *Make sure to search for for one who specializes in (Adult) ADHD (Diagnoses).*  
    * (US): [CHADD link](http://www.help4adhd.org/faq.cfm?fid=3&tid=36) or [Psychology Today link.](http://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_search.php)
    * (Canada): [CADDAC link.](http://www.caddac.ca/cms/page.php?143)
  10. Print out the lists and compare them.  You will make notes on these lists.  
  11. Call doctors your insurance covers and ask if they are accepting new patients.  Start with the ADHD specialists.  They may be scheduling months in advance.  
    * Talk to the doctors on the phone if you can, ask questions and get a 'feel' for how you might work together.    
    * Make notes on your list of the day and time you called and what they said about scheduling and whether they're accepting new patients.  Make notes about your conversation -- if they seemed like a person with whom you'd work well.
  12. Decide which doctor you want to try first.  If your 'favorite' isn't scheduling for six months, it's best to choose someone else first.  (Some offices keep a waiting list, so you can ask to be put on that.  Make a note of this.)
  13. Call your chosen doctor's office back and schedule an appointment.  
  14. Ask them the process of sending your medical records to them.  
  15. Call your current (or previous) doctor(s) and proved the necessary information for sending your medical records to the new doctor's office.

### ADD vs. ADHD?

It's all "ADHD", and in fact the ADD label has been discarded with the adoption of the DSM-IV in 1994. It used to refer to what is now one of the three presentations called ADHD-PI.


### ADHD Presentations  (All persons with ADHD will exhibit most symptoms to some degree or another.)

#### ADHD-PI, Predominantly Inattentive

* *(previously ADD or ADHD-I)*: Characterized by a predominance of:
* forgetfulness
* disorganization
* inattentive to conversation
* fails to give attention to details
* etc...

#### ADHD-PH, Predominantly Hyperactive (& Impulsive)

* Characterized by a predominance of:
* excessive talking
* constantly interrupting people
* constant fidgeting
* trouble waiting their turn
* trouble participating in leisure activities quietly
* etc...

#### ADHD-C, Combined

* Is assigned when the person exhibits a distribution of symptoms across the other types.
