# Grilling (fruits and vegetables)

* Cut tomatoes in half, and cut an X into the flesh.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper, drizzle with olive oil, and tuck a basil leaf in the incision.  Then grill face up.

* Quarter zucchini and summer squash lengthwise.  Trim the ends off asparagus spears.  Slice thick wedges of sweet onion.   Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and finely minced garlic.  Drizzle with olive oil.  Grill.

* Slice thick wedges of beets.  Par-cook them in the microwave.  Peel (carefully because they'll be hot).  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Drizzle with olive oil.  Grill.

* Cut stone fruit and apples in half.  Pit or core, as applicable.  Fill with a mix of chopped nuts, a dab of butter, a sprinkle of brown sugar, a dash of cinnamon (or other spice), and a splash of brandy or rum.  Grill face up.
