## **[Sea-salted Dark Chocolate Caramel "KIND" Bar](http://www.theyummylife.com/recipes/324)** 
I used brown sugar in place of the honey, for the 'caramel' taste. =D I also add vanilla and orange extracts, espresso powder, a hint of cinnamon and cayenne to the chocolate to create complexity.

## [Gingerbread healthy breakfast muffins!](http://www.theyummylife.com/magic_muffins)
Several other flavors; can be Healthy Breakfast Bread Pudding, too.

## [Triple Gingersnaps](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/ginger-snaps-recipe.html)
*This recipe has half the butter, 25% less sugar, and more flavor than the original.*  

####Ingredients

* 2 1/4 c. unbleached AP flour
* 1 1/2 t. baking soda
* 1 T. ground ginger
* 1/2 t. ground cardamom
* 1/4 t. ground cinnamon
* 1/8 t. ground lemon peel  (Adds extra 'zing.')
* 1/8 t. ground black pepper (Adds extra 'snap.')
* 1/2 t. kosher salt

* 3/4 c. dark brown sugar
* 2.5 oz. unsalted butter, room temperature
* 1/4 c. molasses, by weight
* 1 large egg, room temperature
* 2 t. finely grated fresh ginger
* 2 oz. finely chopped candied ginger

####Directions

Preheat the oven to 375˚F.

In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, ginger, spices, and salt.

Place the brown sugar and butter into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on low speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the molasses, egg and fresh ginger and beat on medium for 1 minute. Add the crystallized ginger and using a rubber spatula, stir to combine. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir until well combined.

With a 2-teaspoon sized scoop, drop the dough onto a parchment-lined half sheet pan approximately 2 inches apart. Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 10 minutes for slightly chewy cookies or 12 minutes for more crisp cookies. Rotate the pan halfway through cooking.

Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to stay on the sheet pan for 30 seconds before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with all of the dough. Store in an airtight container for up 10 days. If desired, you may scoop and freeze the cookie dough on a sheet pan and once frozen, place in a resealable bag to store. Bake directly from the freezer as above.

*Alternately, I roll the dough into a 2" DIY cookie dough 'tube' in parchment, foil, and saran layers, then freeze.  When ready to bake, simply unwrap, slice ~3/8" thick and bake as directed above, re-wrapping and returning the remaining frozen dough to the freezer for a later date.*

  ***(My mistake cut half the fat and made a BETTER cookie!)***
