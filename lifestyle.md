# Lifestyle Habits and Impacts

Eating, hydrating, sleeping, and exercising routines can have a surprising effect on the perceived efficacy of medication(s).  Optimizing all of these aspects can help *anyone*, with or without ADHD.

## There is no 'right' diet or exercise routine for ADHD.

### The *best* diet & fitness plan is [S.A.F.E.](http://www.fitocracy.com/knowledge/the-4-things-effective-fitness-programs-have-in-common/)
***[Sustainable, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient (S.A.F.E.)](http://www.fitocracy.com/knowledge/the-4-things-effective-fitness-programs-have-in-common/)***

* **Sustainable** -- One you can **maintain for a long time**, months, or even years.

* **Accountable** -- Involve a friend, SO, partner, family member, online community, etc.  **Avoid relying on willpower alone.**  Also, involving another person might be easier than trying to track every morsel, for someone with ADHD.

* **Flexible** -- **"Your fitness plan should revolve around YOU, not you revolving around the plan."**  Aim for the 'middle of the road', i.e., progress without giving up all food, fun, and freedom.  You can't always control your life, but you can *forgive yourself* for getting off-track.  
Take note of the concept of ***'zig-zagging'*** or ***'cycling' calories***, and realize you **don't have to hit the same exact target every day.**  *Flexibility is KEY with ADHD.*

* **Efficient** -- **Figure out your Minimal Effective Dose (M.E.D.) of Exercise.** (This will keep your plan *sustainable*.)  "[T]he most time any Average Joe or Jane needs to spend in the gym is 3-4 days a week for about 45-60 minutes."  

Also, **[know your caloric requirement.](http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm)**  Don't attempt *extreme* caloric deficit, i.e., unless under a doctor's supervision, caloric goal for weight loss should never be under your RMR and never under 8 Calories per *current* pound of body weight.  The simplest diet plan is to track your Caloric intake and your protein needs, while letting your other macro-nutrients (fat and carbohydrates) fall where they may.

## Hydrating

### Volume: "8 glasses a day" is wrong.

"8 glasses a day" is actually insufficient for most people under normal conditions.  *(Assuming they're 8 oz. glasses, for 64 oz. per day.)*

Find a hydration calculator that uses your weight, activity level, and climate.

* You won't need the same hydration every day -- variations in amount of exercise and extreme temperature changes will alter it.  Some calculators will indicate that.  
  * Try three calculators and average the result.  Beware the sources of the calculators -- I tried to find three that seem 
  * [A formula you can use offline (US units)](http://www.slenderkitchen.com/how-to-calculate-how-much-water-you-should-drink-a-day/)  Multiply your weight (in pounds) by 2/3 to equal the number of ounces of water you should drink daily, and add 12 oz. for every 30 minutes you exercise.  *Climate / temperature not accounted for.*
  * [Calculates daily average *and* increase needed with specific exercise types and durations. (US & Metric)](http://www.hydracoach.com/calculation/indexmetric.html)  *Climate / temperature not accounted for.*  
  * [Incorporates each day's activity level *and* climate. (US & Metric)](http://www.boldsky.com/health/daily-water-intake-calculator/)

### Frequency:  Pee Breaks = Water Breaks.

The 'pee' test indicates that your urine output should be a pale yellow, if you're drinking enough water, but this may vary depending on certain foods, medications, supplements, and medical conditions.  *Ask your doctor!*

7-12 trips to pee per day are recommended for healthy people.  9 trips a day is one in the morning, plus one every two hours (if you're awake 16 hours).  

Every time you get up to pee, drink a glass of water -- just make sure that glass size is ~1/8th of your daily needs! 

### Types:  Water is Best.

Avoid too much caffeine, sugar or other sweeteners (including juices) because these can have negative effects on other aspects of health.  Stick to water, and [try some of these variations in the wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/wiki/water)

Average intake is 20% of our hydration from foods, and if you're eating too little because of appetite-suppressing medications or because the heat suppresses your appetite, you're even more underhydrated.  

* There are lots of melons, grapes, berries, pineapple, apples, citrus fruits, etc. which are marvelous chilled and 'plain' on a hot day.  Or make a parfait with 2% Greek yogurt.

* [Try adding lots of water-rich fruits and vegetables to your summer diet  -- recipes in the wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/wiki/recipes)

## Eating 

**Frequency, volume, and quality of food can have a surprising effect on the perceived efficacy of your medication(s), as well as help mitigate adverse effects.**

* [A compilation of some of my recipes in the wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/wiki/recipes), which are slowly being migrated to [a place with easier formatting](https://gourmetscientist.blogspot.com/), with my initial musings about Meal Planning and Meal Prep.

### Frequency
When on a road trip, you wouldn't expect your car to handle 400 gallons of gas all at once--it needs regular refueling.  The same is true with our bodies, **regular, reasonably-sized meals will keep moods and energy more even throughout the day.**

### Volume
**[Know your caloric requirement.](http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm)**  Don't attempt *extreme* caloric deficit, i.e., unless under a doctor's supervision, caloric goal for weight loss should never be under your RMR and never under 8 Calories per *current* pound of body weight.  

The simplest diet plan is to track your Caloric intake and your protein needs, while letting your other macro-nutrients (fat and carbohydrates) fall where they may.  Use [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) or a similar website and/or app to track these.  Most will set specific numbers for each day.  It's nearly impossible to get all targets *exactly* every day.  Instead, monitor your weekly averages and allow yourself ±5-10% daily range.

### Quality 
You can eat *more* food when you consume **low-Caloric density foods** like **lean produce and protein.**  The next characteristic to include is **high-nutrient density foods** such as **complex carbohydrates and healthier fats.**  High-Caloric density and low-nutrient density foods like desserts and fast foods should be kept to a minimum, but not excluded entirely.  If you 'ban' any certain food, it's harder to fight cravings.  Instead, allow yourself the occasional small indulgence.  It is possible to have healthy, delicious, visually- and aromatically-appealing meals--I do it all the time, and I share my recipes freely!

Whole foods you prepare yourself are ideal -- more nutrient dense and less expensive.  Rely on meal planning and make intentional leftovers so you can cook once and eat many times.  

Supplements should only ever be used as a supplement, usually after you track your food intake carefully for a few weeks, if you find it difficult to adjust your menu to incorporate certain micro-nutrients (vitamins and minerals).  Even then, discuss any supplements with your doctor(s) as they can interfere with absorption of other micro-nutrients as well as interfere with medications.  Supplements are expensive, and that money is better spent on better quality foods.  Supplements typically have lower bio-availability than their counterparts found in foods as well.

I chose to add whey protein powder to my smoothies to add an additional 20g of protein to my day, because I find it difficult to eat an additional meal either for reasons of time or energy, and smoothies are quick and easy.  I used [NFS Sport Certified listings](http://www.nsfsport.com/listings/certified_products_results.asp) and [Labdoor](https://labdoor.com/rankings/protein) to find a plain protein powder that only has the ingredients and the amount of protein listed.  No heavy metals and no 'free amino acids' that are used as a cheap filler so the powder tests as high protein, but that your body doesn't utilize well.

### Meal Planning, Learning How to Cook, etc.

1. Make a list of foods you like.

2. Find healthier versions of the recipes online. There is a list of sites that have I have found reliable and tasty on the sidebar here -- https://gourmetscientist.blogspot.com/

3. Make a plan of what you'd like to eat/make for the week. Start simple. You can increase complexity in later weeks. (If you still live with your parents, or if you see them often, ask them for help if you need to learn any cooking skills -- if they know such skills. If they don't know them, they might be interested in watching videos with you to learn them together.)  [TheKitchn](http://www.thekitchn.com) has instructional cooking videos.  

4. Make a list of the ingredients you need for those meals.

5. Check your fridge, freezer, and pantry for the ingredients you have. (Ask your parents for help if you need to, if you live with them.) Mark off the things you have. Maybe make a new list of groceries you need.

There are a bunch of notes about the whole process [here.](https://gourmetscientist.blogspot.com/search/label/Tips%20%26%20Notes)

### **OJ, fruit, vitamin C myth.** 

There's a myth circulating that fruits, juices, and other acids ruin the efficacy of ADHD medications.

####Vitamin C and fruit are ***NOT*** an issue.

####Eat balanced meals and you'll be fine.

The issue arises when a 'meal' consists of JUST black coffee or fruit juice or if someone takes a vitamin C supplement or antacids with their amphetamine-class medication -- both will ["[negatively alter] blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines."](http://www.rxlist.com/adderall-drug/side-effects-interactions.htm)

## Sleep Habits  

***Routines are key to developing better sleep habits.***

###Try developing a bedtime routine:

* Turn off all screens and get ready for bed.

* Gather your stuff for tomorrow and pack it up (books etc.) or lay it out (clothes, shoes).  Pack your lunch for tomorrow and leave it in the fridge.
* Write out a list of tomorrow's tasks and other thoughts (to get them off your mind).
* Take a quick cooling shower -- your body needs to feel cool to trigger "it's time for sleep."
* Try some meditation.  *[This is a non-hippy one that works for me.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzsV6ZwZvlQ)  I usually do it while lying in bed.  Sometimes I loop it repeatedly until it starts to work. =P*
* Try breathing exercises, like [the 4-7-8 Method.](http://higherperspectives.com/fall-asleep-fast/)


###For making mornings easier:

* Use a daily pill minder; fill it once a week and leave it bedside with a glass of water the night before.

* Set an alarm 30-60 minutes early and take your meds (that you left bedside with a glass of water the night before). Then go back to sleep until your real alarm.

## Hobbies

Hobbies can be a creative outlet, an active meditation, or generally add balance to life.  Learning a new hobby can be a way to practice building habits.

[Wikipedia's List of Hobbies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies) -- try using these terms for your interests to find relevant subreddits, and specifically look for subreddits that are geared toward helping you learn or improve.  If you prefer discussing a topic over doing the activity, there are subreddits for that, but beware devoting more time to internet conversations over engaging in real-life activities.  Also look for inexpensive hobbies.  People with ADHD have a tendency to be enamored of a new thing for only a short while.  It's fiscally irresponsible to invest heavily in a hobby until you have a better idea whether it will be a long-term interest.

Some commonly mentioned hobbies and subreddits that can help -- check for relevant subreddits linked in the sidebars:

* **Cooking:**  /r/Cooking, /r/cookingforbeginners, /r/slowcooking, /r/EatCheapAndHealthy, & /r/budgetfood 
* **Drawing & Painting:**  /r/LearnArt & /r/Painting
* **Languages:**  /r/languagelearning
* [**Music** Learning & Instruments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/wiki/musicsubreddits#wiki_music_making_subreddits)
* **Writing & Calligraphy:**  /r/WritingHub/ & /r/Calligraphy

## Ending Unhealthy Habits
Sometimes it's necessary to break habits to be healthier.  Often it helps to focus on healthier habits to keep yourself busy, but there are other resources that can be found in **/r/addiction** and the many "Stop" subreddits in their sidebar.
