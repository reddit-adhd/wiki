## Cleaning

###General Cleaning:
1. Turn on happy music, open blinds and maybe windows, turn on lights. Notice and admire the improvement.  

2. Put dirty clothes in hamper or washer.  Fold and put away clean clothes.  Notice and admire the improvement.  
3. Put trash and recycling into appropriate containers.  Notice and admire the improvement.   
4. Put dirty dishes in sink.  Put away any clean dishes.  Notice and admire the improvement.  
5. Pick up and put away books and other items.  Notice and admire the improvement.  
6. Straighten your bed, couch, and other furniture.  Notice and admire the improvement.  
7. Dust, sweep, vacuum, mop, as needed.  Notice and admire the improvement.  
8. Sprinkle/spray bathroom fixtures with cleanser/spray.  Wipe mirrors and counters.  Clean sink.  Clean toilet.  Clean tub.^†  Notice and admire the improvement.  
9. Stand back and admire your work! Take a break and give yourself a small reward!

^† *Heat one cup of vinegar in the microwave and mix with one cup of undiluted liquid dish soap in a spray bottle. Spray on tub/shower and 'wipe' with a green scrubby — no actual scrubbing! =D*

### Cleaning Upkeep:
Try setting boxes or baskets by the doorway of the room for quick sorting.  "Trash", "recycle", "donate", "belongs in other room(s)", and "goes back in *this* room".

### Laundry

#### Downsizing a wardrobe or closet.  

1. Get rid of anything with holes or stains.  (Take a picture of anything with sentimental value, then you don't have to keep the item itself.(

2. Get rid of anything you know you don't like, that you know you don't wear, or that you know isn't flattering.

3. Hang everything else on hangers, and make them face backward on the rod.  At the end of a year, get rid all the ones you haven't used (those that are still facing the other way on the rod.)  

#### Routine Laundry

* Mount hooks or a rod near your washer and dryer (if possible).  (A tension rod, like a shower curtain rod will work without causing physical damage if there's a narrow enough space.)  

* Keep empty hangers there.
* When your laundry is barely damp / almost dry, pull the items from the dryer and hang them immediately on a hanger, place that on the hooks/rod.
  * [Hangers for slacks, pants, and trousers](http://www.organizeit.com/images/5slackha.jpg) let you fold pants so they get a subtle crease in them, and hang several with one hook, in a space-saving manner in your closet.  
  * [Skirt hangers](http://images.containerstore.com/catalogimages/151253/4TierSkirtHgr10058165_x.jpg) are similar.
  * There are even space-saving [shirt hangers](http://www.theholdingcompany.co.uk/images/products/large/pf_MSA002.jpg) (for button-up shirts only).
* Take a batch of loaded hangers to place in the closet.
* Place boxes as "bins" in the top dresser drawer for various types of underwear, socks, etc.
  * Match socks.
  * Consider replacing all of your socks with just one type of sock, or two obviously-different types such as one dress type and one sport type, to make matching easier.
  * Other under things don't need to be folded, just sorted into the bins.  (Shoe boxes can be cut in half to make smaller bins.)
* PJs and workout clothing can be folded and placed in a drawer, as this drawer and these clothes either don't need to be as tidy or avoid wrinkling better.
* Removing clothing at the right time saves much (if not all) time you might spend ironing.
