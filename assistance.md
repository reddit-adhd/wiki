## Academic Resources  

### K-12 Resources  
  *(To be added.)*

### [USA State Apprenticeship Training Help](/r/adhd/wiki/assistance/apprenticeship)

### College/University Resources  
When you start or return to school (or if you can arrange it 1-2 weeks in advance, all the better).  Remember you can call or email most of these places even further in advance to get locations, operating hours, and contact information to input into your schedule and contacts before you start school.  This will save you from frantically running around the first week of classes.  

1. Ask your campus tutoring center if they offer Academic Coaching.  
2. Ask your campus Disability Center if they offer a type of coaching or accommodations for a personal tutor.  
  *Some possible names of this resource:*
  * Disabled Student Services 
  * Disabled Student Center 
  * Disabled Student Resources 
  * Disability Student Services 
  * Disability Student Center 
  * Disability Student Resources 
  * Disability Access Center
  * Office of Disability Services 
  * Office of Disability Resources      
  * Office of Students with Disabilities
3. Ask your campus Disability Center what other resources they offer, such as note-takers, audio or electronic transcription of textbooks, accessibility softwares, etc.   
4. Ask your campus health center for any sort of counseling.  
5. Ask your department for a mentor.  
6. Visit your campus/department tutoring center daily. Commit to it like it's a class.  
7. Visit your professors' office hours religiously as well.  
8. Set up study groups a couple days before each assignment is due.  

(These last three things will build accountability into your schedule, as you will feel you must prepare something before any of these other people see it.)  


### How to Study *(Works for all levels.)*  
**Build structure into your studying in order to compensate for 'focusing'.**  

1. Read the text ahead of time; don't worry about comprehension as much as familiarizing yourself with terms and concepts.  
2. Use the cornell method on your text.  
3. This will let you take specific questions to your classes.  
4. Then you can read again (at least the confusing parts) after, and revise/summarize your notes (using the Cornell method) as soon after class as possible.  
5. Don't worry about things you don't understand (at this point) just try to understand as much of it as possible in a reasonable time; make note of your questions for study groups and office hours.  
6. Read and attempt homework problems.  Don't worry about finishing each one; look them over and finish the easy ones first.  
7. Take your questions and problems to study group.  
8. Go back and re-attempt your homework, re-read the text (or other sources) where you're confused.  
9. Go to office hours and ask any more questions you may have.  
10. Go back and rework the sticky issues.  

Each of these steps should take 15-45 minutes per class per day -- this is where the Pomodoro technique comes in!

## Regional (Government) Resources
**Note they can help with academics, medical coverage, and jobs, depending on location.**  
*These resources may exist in countries other than the US, so try some searching, ask your doctor(s), and call your campus disability or career center and ask.*

1. Ask your campus disability center for contact information for your state's Department of (Vocational) Rehabilitation.
2. Google search Department of (Vocational) Rehabilitation and your state's name.  Also try with the term "ADHD."  
  *Some possible names of this resource:*
  * Department of Rehabilitation.
  * Department of Vocational Rehabilitation.
  * Office of Rehabilitation.
  * Office of Vocational Rehabilitation.
  * Department of Rehabilitation Services.
  * Department of Vocational Rehabilitation Services.
  * Office of Rehabilitation Services.
  * Office of Vocational Rehabilitation Services.

## Medical Resources

***[This site can help you locate various medical clinics, pharmaceutical cost help, etc.](http://www.needhelppayingbills.com/html/help_with_medical_bills.html)***

### Insurance / Affordable Care Act (ACA, US) Resources
  *(To be added.)*


### Pharmaceutical Discount Sites & Cards  
* [goodrx.com](http://www.goodrx.com/) can help you locate the best pharmacy prices in your area.  They also offer links to assistance programs, discount cards, and information about alternatives and generics.  

If you don't fall under the income restrictions, look at other prescription discount programs.  With AAA, for example ["save an average of 35% on generic drugs and an average of 15% on brand name drugs"](http://discounts.aaa.com/prescription.htm).  (AAA can also save you money in an untold number of other places -- I don't work for them, and I generally loathe endorsing any specific brand or company, but this is one that's truly worth it.)

### Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Patient Assistance Programs   
*For those who are currently lacking prescription coverage.  This can sometimes include lacking coverage for specific medications.*  

* Google: manufacturer of {medication}.  
* Search {manufacturer} {medication} Patient Assistance {current year}.  *(Include current year to avoid out-of-date links.)*  
* Investigate the income restrictions.  

Some of the older drugs, e.g. Adderall, no longer have PPAs as Shire is trying to convert patients to their new, still-under-patent and therefore more profitable Vyvanse.  Consider (with discussion with your doctor) changing your medication to qualify for the plans.

Some examples:

* [Participating Patient Assistance Programs](http://www.pparx.org/en/prescription_assistance_programs/list_of_participating_programs)  
* [Vyvanse](http://www.shire.com/shireplc/en/contactus/patientassistance)  
* [Concerta](http://www.rxassist.org/Search/Prog_Details.cfm?program_Id=327&PD_Id=1281&Drug_Id=2202&Company_Id=141&search_type=2&CFID=8205716&CFTOKEN=87613118)  
* [Focalin](http://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/info/about-us/our-patient-caregiver-resources/paf-enrollment.jsp?program=3-3-1B-11)  


### Other Prescription Resources  
Try searching: "prescription discount" with and without the current year.


### Medical (Doctor) Resources  
Apply for state programs and local clinics.  They may at least cover the costs of doctor visits and any other medications prescribed -- this will take pressure off your budget so you can possibly afford ADHD medications, but they often have income guidelines as well.
