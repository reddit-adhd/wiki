##The Netherlands' process for diagnosis and medication

*(submitted via modmail)*

### Getting a diagnosis:
 
* You have to get a referral from your GP/physician/'huisarts'. Make sure you specifically mention wanting to get tested for ADHD.
* Next you'll be advised to see a specialist. I can recommend deciding on what institute you want to go yourself, and then asking your GP to refer you to that specific institute. This can go two ways: you can either go to a centralized/franchise mental healthcare institute or a independently established/local specialist. The best known centralized institutes are the GGZ or PsyQ. While everyone has different experiences, going to a centralized franchise is highly recommended for a number of reasons:
        * They usually have a lot of experience with every part of your treatment, ranging from a lot of knowledge about ADHD to practical stuff like keeping your GP updated and writing prescriptions.
        * They have psychologists, psychiatrists, and other specialists in the same building/facility. You don't need to be referred when you need a different type of specialist.
* Once you've enrolled you'll have to do an intake (either in person or over the phone), and you'll start the diagnosis trial.
* While processes might differ between different providers, the diagnosis trial usually consists of (in no particular order) an intake, a couple of questionnaires, and some conversations. It's also likely that they'll ask if you can bring along a relative or close friend to give some perspective at some point.  *Editor's note: This can occur in one long multi-hour session, or many one-hour sessions.  Some of the tests and questionnaires may be online, on a computer in the office, or on paper.*
 
### Medication and insurance
 
ADHD medication is mostly covered in the medication compensation act/geneesmiddelen vergoedingssysteem (GVS). This means that medication registered in the GVS are covered by all basic healthcare insurances. However, different brands or generics may or may not be covered, and might require additional payment.

* At PsyQ after this intake they give you a "guessed" diagnosis. The "official" diagnosis will be done after the psychologist discusses your case with a psychiatrist.
