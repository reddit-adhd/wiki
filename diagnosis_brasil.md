**Session One (Interview):**

It was just an interview.
The doc (a neuropsychologist) asked me a bunch of questions like:
How long I had the problems I reported, how was my child life, how I was at school, work, etc.
Asked me about why I looked for help.

Also he asked for a way to contact my parents and later asked them some questions about my past and things that I might not remember, like when I started to walk / talk, how long I was breastfeed, etc.

*Personal view: It was really just a conversation and even tough I feel a bit nervous due to my normal anxiety it went very well.*

**Session Two  (Tests begin):**

The second session was a LOT different than the previous one.
No questions about my past and not much conversation.
Just a lot of tasks that I had to complete.
They were like:

* Tell me what is the meaning of this word (and then the doc told me a lot of words while I answered with the meaning)

* Explain what is the meaning of these popular sayings
* Sort frames with images in a meaningful order
* Repeat a sequence of numbers and/or letters 
* Repeat a sequence (but sorting it).
* Mark if a specific symbol is present in a line (several times)
* Press "Space" in a keyboard when I hear "1" (during several minutes)
* Solve some math problems like:
 > John has 3 apples and went for the supermarket to buy more fruits. There he found that he actually didn't need only fruits but vegetables too and bought 5 carrots and a pineapple. Now john is back at home and I ask: How many fruits John have now? 

*Personal view: No idea how I went, except for the repeating part and math problems.  This was the part of the test I had most troubles doing. In both of them I had problems remembering what the doc said at the start... The math problems were very simple but they were long and with a lot of things. This example is a made-up question, but they were like this, I just can't remember the exact questions.  After these tasks I felt REALLY exhausted due to how difficult it is to me remember things that aren't very interesting.*

**Session Three:**

It started with 2 different attention tests:

* The first I had to mark in a sheet full of symbols every time I saw any of three different symbol that were on the top of the page. If I recall correctly it was called "divided attention test" (translated from Brasilian Portuguese, may be called something else in English.)

* The second one was basically the same, but each row in the sheet had its own symbol to be compared with other symbols in the same row.  If I recall correctly it was called "alternating attention test"

* After that, the next test I was presented with one picture at time and had to tell what was missing in the image. This test started very easy but became more and more difficult. Like for example a image full of details but one small object did not have a shadow.

* The next test was a cube design test on which I had to reproduce an image using cubes half red half white.  [A picture of the cubes.](http://log24.com/log/images/020831-wechsler.jpg)  [An example of what I had to reproduce with the cubes.](http://imgur.com/a/GJ25q)  

* [The following test I needed to color a pyramid like this one.](http://imgur.com/a/n9eVB)  Using little colored squares of several colors. 

*Personal view: Again I had a bad time with the tasks where I had to keep something in my memory (like the divided and alternating attention tests) and the one where I had to find the missing part of the image. The rest of the test was very easy and I still don't know for example what is the purpose of the pyramid test.*

**Session Four:**

This was the last test session.

* It started with a game with a board full of color names but colored with different colors than the word itself.  Ex: The word "RED" colored in blue, [like this one](http://www.illusions.org/dp/files/1-41.gif)  I had to read the color of which the word was written, not the word itself. The doc used a stopwatch to measure my reading speed.

* Then I had a test on which I had to reproduce [this figure](https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/204/3001689/PMC3001689_PSM-07-07-g-001.png) by looking to it.  It's called [Rey-Osterrieth complex figure (ROCF) test.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rey%E2%80%93Osterrieth_complex_figure)

* Followed by another test of attention where I had several letters in a sheet (d, p) with a symbol (') above or below the letter. I had to mark every time I found a "d" with two symbols (') under/above or both. Some had only one, some had three.  I had to stop the row and go to the next one every 20 seconds.

* I also had a questionnaire to identify depression or others co-morbid issues.

* Then I had to draw that figure from the second test, but now without the reference, just by memory, in 2 minutes.

*Personal view: The most difficult part was to draw that figure by memory. I can't recall exactly what I did, but looking at the original after the test, I can say that I did a shit job in this part.  Also the "d / p" test was very difficult, cause I keep looking not just to the letter that I'm supposed to look, but to the next and previous one....*

**Session Five:**

This was my feedback session.

* It was relatively short, and started with the reading of my report.  If the results suggest ADHD, it can only be "officially" confirmed by a psychiatrist.

* I also got the results of personality tests and attention tests.

* Any medication or other therapy will be managed by my current psychiatrist.

*Personal results omitted.*
