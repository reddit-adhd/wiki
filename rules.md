#Subreddit Rules 
##Do:

###Use a specific and meaningful title when posting

A good title hooks readers and can help foster discussion.  Given the audience of the subreddit, it is not uncommon for post bodies to not be read in their entirety (or at all).  If your title is straight to the point, it can make it easier for people to respond.  The body of the post can and should expand on the title. 

###Be supportive of your fellow ADHDers

We're all in this together, but we all have our own ways of dealing.  What works for you may not work for someone else (and the opposite as well), but that doesn't mean anything is inherently bad or wrong.

###Ask for support, life advice

We're a support community!  Want to find out what worked for other people and try to apply that to your life?  Go for it!  
This does not mean you can't ask other things as well, this is a suggestion / example is all.

###Cite relevant studies when appropriate

Percentages and statistics get thrown around, knowledge is often shared, but how do we verify it?  
For example:  If Bob says "60% of ADHD people have a high IQ" then a citation should be made to determine if the source is credible.


##Do not:

### Be a jerk

* Please participate in an adult manner; comment positively & treat others with respect.

* Being purposely offensive or antagonistic can get you banned, even if you don't technically violate any of the numbered rules.

* This includes things like accusing submitters of lying, starting arguments on purpose, or calling people names, using insults and other types of harassment.

* This also includes things like arguing with the moderators about the rules, or inciting others to break them.

* Breaking this rule is the quickest route to being banned.

* If you see somebody being a jerk, please report the offending comment to the mods and move on. Do not engage in flamewars or escalation. 

### Post seeking medical advice

We are not doctors, pharmacists, nurses, or anyone else with a medical degree.  Anyone who claims to be such a profession may very well be lying.  **Always** discuss medical questions and concerns with a medical professional that you know and trust.  It can be very dangerous to take the advice of a stranger on the internet.

###Ask if you have ADHD

We are not doctors.  We are internet people and should not be trusted with the direction of your medical treatment.  Posts asking if you have ADHD or if these symptoms sound like ADHD are not allowed because we have an obvious bias.  The reality is that everyone experiences these symptoms at one or more points in their lives.  The symptoms may also be from a *different* disorder (depression, anxiety, OCD, etc.) A professional can work with you to determine what the issue is and your best way to combat it.

###Ask if you should get checked out for ADHD (the answer is always yes)

Explanation as above.

###Ask how you get diagnosed for ADHD

The process is started by talking to a psychiatrist.  We will not help anyone game the system to score drugs.

###Ask how you get prescribed medication

The process is started by talking to a psychiatrist.  We will not help anyone game the system to score drugs.

###Post without searching first

Many of the questions and topics posted here are asked often and frequently.  In an effort to not flood the subreddit with similar topics, please search the subreddit for keywords related to your question or topic.  

###Talk about illicit or recreational drug acquisition or usage, drug abuse, or independent drug/substance experimentation.

This is a support community for those with ADHD.  Obviously there is going to be talk about medication, but it should always be in the context of medication prescribed for ADHD.  Talk about drug abuse, recreational usage, or substances like nootropics are prohibited because it is not recognized treatment for ADHD.  There are other communities to discuss these topics.

###Ask about medication side effects without first consulting your doctor or pharmacist

Medication side effects and medication concerns should always be brought up to your prescribing doctor or pharmacist, as they are best equipped to answer your questions.

Also, everyone experiences the medications in their own way.  Side effects that one person experiences may not exhibit in the same degree or at all for another.

###Ask a question that can be answered with simply yes or no

*This includes DAE/HAE (Does Anyone Else/Has Anyone Else) style questions.*

Yes or no questions have a tendency to not promote discussion.  If you are curious about something, ask a more detailed question.
	
**Example:**

* *Do you sweat a lot on medication?* should be along the lines if **How do you combat medication-induced sweating?**
	
This engages readers and increases chances of people offering help and ideas.  Often times when someone asks a DAE-style post, they are indeed looking for more than just a yes or no, but readers are less likely to provide a more in depth answer if the question can just be answered without any thought.

###Post memes

/r/ADHD is a support group.  Memes and other "low effort" posts are not very supportive and are often just posted as karma grabs or for "me too" responses.  We do understand that a lot of people enjoy these posts, however, so a separate subreddit was created to be dedicated to this: /r/adhdmeme

###Post links without adding description and discussion in the comments

This goes along the lines of "Use a descriptive and meaningful title."  If you want people to look at your link, you need to start a discussion with it.  

###Post advertisements of any form.

This includes blogs and surveys.  For surveys, you should message the moderators and it will be evaluated on a case by case basis.

###Post or comment about non-standard medications or treatments without scientific evidence

Everyone wants a better way to deal with their ADHD, but suggesting medications and treatments without providing any sort of studies into the efficacy of the medication is simply irresponsible.  Any posts or comments about non-standard medications need to provide links from peer-reviewed scientific journals that support the claims regarding the medication's or treatment's usage for ADHD. 

###Post anecdotal information as factual

Everyone experiences the various medications and treatments in their own way.  To say that one medication is best simply because it worked best for you is irresponsible.  The brain is a complex system that varies heavily from person to person.  Some people respond best to medication A, some people respond best to medication B.  Others fall in the middle, and still others respond poorly to all medications.  Everyone also experiences their ADHD in their own way, so to say that all ADHDers exhibit behaviors, for example, is simply incorrect.
