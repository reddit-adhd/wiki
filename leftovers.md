## Pork
### [Pressure Cooker Pork Ranch Chili](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pressure-cooker-chili-recipe.html)
I crossed that recipe with [this one](http://www.theyummylife.com/Slow_Cooker_Pork_Chili), but mostly followed Alton Brown's directions.

##### Ingredients

    2 teaspoons olive oil 
    1 teaspoon chipotle powder
    1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
    1 teaspoon ground black pepper
    1 teaspoon smoked paprika
    1-2 pounds stew meat (beef, pork, and/or lamb)
    1/2 LARGE sweet onion, diced
    4 medium-large carrots, sliced in thin coins
    4 stalks of celery, diced finely
    4 cloves garlic, minced
    1 large serrano chili, diced
    1 (12-ounce) bottle of beer, preferably a medium ale or dark beer with low IBU
    1 teaspoon oregano
    1 tablespoon dark cocoa powder
    1 (32-ounce) can of diced tomatoes
    1 teaspoon chipotle sauce
    1 large bay leaf
    2 (16-ounce) cans of black beans, drained and rinsed

##### Directions

Place the meat in a large mixing bowl and toss with oil and salt, pepper, chipotle powder, and paprika. Set aside.

Heat a 6-quart heavy-bottomed pressure cooker over high heat until hot. Add the meat and brown on all sides, approximately 2 minutes. Once all of the meat is browned, add the vegetables, saute, then add the beer to the cooker to deglaze the pot.

Scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Add everything else except the beans to the pressure cooker and stir to combine. Lock the lid in place according to the manufacturer's instructions. When the steam begins to hiss out of the cooker, reduce the heat to low, just enough to maintain a very weak whistle. Cook for 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and carefully release the steam. Mix in the black beans.  Serve immediately with 2% Greek yogurt (as sour cream), green onions, aged extra sharp cheddar, and cornbread.

  I do put in sliced onion. And serve with Trader Joe's (something) BBQ sauce. Shredded, and lightly dressed, you can press this into single-serve portions in a gallon zipper bag to freeze. Later, pull out a chunk, add more sauce, and reheat!

  Exactly like it sounds.  With extra sharp cheddar & strong swiss, with slivers of serrano peppers!

###### Ingredients

1 boneless beef chuck (~3 lbs.), cut into 6 large pieces, fat trimmed  
2 t. kosher salt  
1/2 bottle red wine (750 ml), medium-bodied (like Côtes du Rhône)  
10 sprigs fresh parsley leaves  
2 sprigs fresh thyme  
2 bay leaves  
Ground black pepper  
4 oz. lean, uncured, thick-cut bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces crosswise  
1 large onion, sliced lengthwise, ~2 c.  
3 large garlic cloves, minced, ~2 T.  
2 t. Beef Better Than Bullion   
1 c. water  
8 large carrots, peeled and cut on bias into 1 1/2-inch pieces  
1 T. unsalted butter  
2 t. sugar  
10 ounces white mushrooms, wiped clean, stems trimmed, sliced into thirds  
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves  
Salt  

###### Directions

Pull the roast apart at the natural seam and trim away large knobs of fat from each half.   Cut into six large approximately equal chunks.  Season meat with kosher salt, place on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet, and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour.  

Pat beef dry with paper towels and season generously with pepper. 

Cook bacon in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 6 to 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel-lined plate and reserve.

Pour off all but 2 T. fat; return Dutch oven to medium-high heat and heat until fat begins to smoke. Add beef chunks to pot and brown well on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes total. Transfer beef to large plate and set aside.

Reduce heat to medium-low; add onion and ¼ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to soften, 5-6 minutes. Add garlic and reserved bacon; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Slowly whisk in wine, scraping up any browned bits, and simmer over medium heat until thickened and slightly reduced, about 15 minutes.

Stir in the bullion paste, water and herbs, scraping bottom of pan with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. 

Add everything to a crock pot and cook on high for three hours (or low for seven hours), add in the carrots, and cook another hour, until the meat is very tender and a dinner fork slips easily in and out of meat. 

While meat cooks, saute mushrooms in 1 T. olive oil and 1 T. butter; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and glazed, 8 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.

Cook noodles according to package directions.  

Transfer beef to cutting board; tent with foil to keep warm. Allow braising liquid to settle about 5 minutes; then, using wide, shallow spoon, skim fat off surface. Bring sauce to a strong simmer, uncovered, over medium-high heat and cook until thickened and reduced to about 3 cups, about 15-20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Using carving knife, cut meat against grain into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Serve beef mixture over noodles.

## General
### An [alternate trick for crockpot meats](http://www.theyummylife.com/Slow_Cooker_Pulled_Pork).
### A [widely customizable 10-minute gourmet meal](http://imgur.com/a/wVjuZ#1)

#### Sauteed steak (with coffee/sea salt/black pepper rub) or chicken breast (with lemon pepper rub).   
* Prep and microwave "baked" yellow or sweet potatoes.   
* Meanwhile, heat skillet and add ~1T. ea. butter and olive oil.  Sautée rubbed steak, pork chop, or chicken breast 4-6 minutes on each side, turning only once, depending on thickness and desired doneness.  Let rest a few minutes before eating.   
* Microwave-steam frozen green beans, mixed veggies, or broccoli.   
* Top the potatoes with 2% or whole greek yogurt, pepper, and minced chives.   
* If you insist on 'sullying' your veggies, dust with hard cheese of your choice. (Sweet potatoes take well to black pepper, nutmeg, and a drizzle of cream.)  
* This whole meal takes ~10 minutes, and has several variations.

# ["31 Freezer Meal Prep Sessions"](https://newleafwellness.biz/2015/08/17/31-freezer-prep-sessions-that-will-change-your-life/)

This is a good resource I'm trying and will be adapting.  It doesn't seem very "Mix-and-Match" friendly in this format, and I want to change that.
