# Common Questions

## Myths and Misconceptions

### You have to exhibit hyperactivity to have ADHD.
* You do NOT have to be hyperactive to have ADHD. It is more common for children with ADHD to show hyperactive symptoms than it is for adults, and boys are more likely to exhibit hyperactivity than girls. Some children that show hyperactive symptoms may not exhibit those hyperactive symptoms as an adult even if their ADHD persists into adulthood. This does not mean that all children with ADHD will show hyperactive symptoms rather that it is more common in children than adults.


### Only Children have ADHD
* [ADHD exists in both children and adults](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2859678/). Many people think that ADHD is something that only occurs in children. This is far from the truth. 60% of children diagnosed at a young age continue to exhibit ADHD symptoms into and throughout adulthood. A diagnosis requirement is that symptoms must have occurred by age 7. This has been criticized as far to strict because of late onset and the ambiguity of what exactly causes ADHD and when it happens. [Here is an article](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=97104) from The American Journal of Psychiatry where they explicitly go after and test the idea of such a low onset age.


### ADHD is just a bad behavior
* ADHD is neither bad behavior nor a behavioral disorder. Like I stated above, ADHD is a developmental disorder created by a dysfunction of the executive functions regulating the brain and chemical imbalances. It is sometimes called a behavioral disorder because ADHD has a horrible name that describes the symptoms of the disorder. This has caused a lot of confusion. These symptoms are NOT the disorder, the name is just a description of the difficulties faced by people with the ADHD.

### [ADHD is just a 'Big Pharma' scam to make more money](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3e2t6v/i_am_neurobill_im_a_neuroscientist_who_had_worked/ctbcd0y)
*(Answered by a neuroscientist with ADHD in /r/AskScience.)*  
>[T]he most commonly prescribed ADHD medications have been out from under patent protection for some time now. They are available generically and therefore are not a very huge moneymaker for pharmaceutical companies.


## [What is ADHD from a neuroscience perspective?](https://www.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/3ex7ko/explain_like_im_18_what_is_adhd_from_a/ctjciiu) 
*(Answered in /r/neuroscience.)* 
> ADHD is a complex neurological phenomenon that has been studied for a while now. The thing is, neurological disorders can be studied at different levels of magnification, so to say. 
> 
> For example, if you ask somebody who studies circuits in the brain they will tell you that ADHD is due to misformed frontal-subcortical-cerebellar catecholaminergic circuits, which basically means that the connections between certain types of neurons in a certain area of the brain are dysregulated and somehow pathalogical.
> 
>  If you ask a neuropharmacologist, they will tell you that most signs point towards an impairment of the dopamine transporter, which causes imbalances during neurotransmitter release. If you ask a molecular biologist or biochemist they might tell you that it has been traced all the way back to the metabolism of the brain, where oxidative metabolism is impaired.
> 
>  If you ask a geneticist, they will tell you it can be traced all the way back to your genes and epigenetic background. Twin, adoption, and molecular genetic studies show ADHD to be highly heritable, and as far is I remember psychosocial adversity during childhood has also been shown to be a predisposing risk factor (thus the epigenetic influence). 
> 
> Basically, it is a complex disease that is caused by a large number of factors. Think about a disease like huntingtons. You either have it or you dont, and it can all be traced back to 1 single gene. Its a unifactorial disease. Thats why we understand it relatively thoroughly. Its straighforward.
> 
>  Diseases like ADHD are multifactorial, meaning its harder to pin down exactly what causes them, because many contributions are made from different factors. Also, the disease has different levels of penetrance and expressivity. If you do a quick search of the literature you will find 100s of papers that all talk about different genetic variants, different environmental factors, and different treatment paradigms all associated with ADHD. Because of this, its possible that 2 people exhibit the symptoms of ADHD, but there might not be the same cause, or more accurately, set of causes. This can be substantiated by the fact that several genome wide association studies have failed to identify any particular genome wide association. 
> 
> Thats not to say that there is no genetic cause, because we know there is, but rather than the causes are likely numerous, and therefore evade detection when some particular methods are used. I mean, if A, B, and C all contribute to a disease, person 1 might have A and B, person 2 might have B and C, and person 3 might have A and C. They are all different, but they all still have the disease. That makes it harder to say what exactly causes it. 
> 
> If you really really really need to narrow it down to 1 particular reason, its probably most strongly due dopaminergic imbalances, due to the fact that you have specific isoforms of genes associated to the dopaminergic system, or due to the fact that there is some significant copy number variation in one of those genes. 
> 
> ADHD has a complex molecular architecture that is hard to summarize.


## [What is happening in an ADHD brain?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3e2t6v/i_am_neurobill_im_a_neuroscientist_who_had_worked/ctb6dow)
*(Answered by a neuroscientist with ADHD in /r/AskScience.)*  
>The brain is... Really ludicrously complex. The tools we have available to us are very limited in their ability to look at the fine details of what's going on in a living human brain. You can do fMRI studies of people with and without ADHD, sure, but even if you DO observe a difference in activity, the area you're seeing that difference in probably contains a hundred million neurons, and you have no way whatsoever of knowing which neurons in that area are acting unusually (since different subgroups of neurons in a given brain structure usually have very different jobs). So our best guesses about what's going on in ADHD are really quite limited.
>
>Here's what we DO know:
>
>The neurotransmitter dopamine (which is often, stupidly, referred to as "the reward chemical") is used by many different brain systems, including some relating to reward or motivation, others relating to movement, one system relating to lactation.. The list goes on. But some of the important dopamine pathways that we believe might be abnormal in people with ADHD are dopamine pathways relating to motivation and attention. This is supported by the finding that certain versions of certain genes that are related to dopamine function are associated with increased risk of ADHD, and also by the fact that drugs that affect dopamine tend to affect ADHD symptoms.
>
>But, there is probably a lot more to it than that. It is almost certainly NOT a simple matter of "too much / too little" of some particular neurotransmitter. The "too much / too little of this neurotransmitter" way of thinking about mental disorders is commonly used to explain things because it's easy to understand, but it's pretty much always wrong. I know of perhaps 1 or 2 disorders that are actually legitimately caused by an overall excess or deficit of a particular chemical in the brain (e.g. phenylketonuria).
>
>Some more nuanced evidence for the pathology of ADHD comes from EEG studies. Among other things, EEG can be used to assess temporary connections between brain areas, in the form of synchronized brainwaves between brain areas. There is some evidence that people with ADHD have abnormal communication between brain areas, particularly involving the frontal cortex, a part of the brain particularly associated with making decisions and evaluating choices, which may be related to the impulsivity and difficulty sticking to a task that people with ADHD often experience.
>
>I think we will find out more within the next couple decades, as methods for both examining the activity of live human brains AND for creating and studying animal models of ADHD (which can potentially assess the role of much more specific neural circuits in the disorder) improve.


## [What are the long-term effects of taking ADHD medications?  Is medication a necessary aspect of treatment?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3e2t6v/i_am_neurobill_im_a_neuroscientist_who_had_worked/ctb5dy5)
*(Answered by a neuroscientist with ADHD in /r/AskScience.)*
>Amphetamine and methylphenidate have been in use for about half a century now, and when taken at the prescribed dose, they are extremely safe. They have a good therapeutic index, meaning that there is a large margin of safety between the dose that will successfully treat ADHD and the dose that is dangerous. They have a very good side effect profile. And there is even some evidence that suggests that, contrary to what popular opinion might have you believe, being given stimulant medication during adolescence can actually produce a long term improvement in the outlook for kids with ADHD.
>
>It's also worth considering that ADHD is a very, very real disability that can hold someone back in life in ways that are sometimes simply impossible for someone without ADHD to understand . About 90% of people with ADHD will respond well to either methylphenidate or amphetamine, and most people experience only very mild side effects. The positive effects, for kids OR adults, can be life-changing. And interventions like teaching study skills simply are not effective. Clinical studies have shown that therapy interventions have relatively little effect on school performance and other ADHD symptoms, but that adding medication makes a very big difference. People with ADHD can learn better ways to handle life, but what they can't do very easily is put it into practice, so the results are disappointing. Medication helps make it possible to take the skills you learn and actually apply them when you need them.
>
>Medication for ADHD does more than just help with schoolwork. I, personally, have had trouble as an adult controlling my emotions and thinking before I speak. Medication has made it much easier for me to think carefully about my own emotions, and find ways to express them that are appropriate to the situation (which has


## [What is the difference between ADHD stimulants and SSRIs?  Don't they "do" the same thing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3e2t6v/i_am_neurobill_im_a_neuroscientist_who_had_worked/ctc0zha)
*(Answered by an expert in Neurophysiology, Biophysics, and Neuropharmacology with ADHD in /r/AskScience.)*
> Absolutely not. SSRIs are 1) slow acting 2) reuptake inhibitors 3) selective for the serotonin transporters. Amphetamines are (in general) rapidly acting 2) Cause reuptake transporters to reverse 3) Act on dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline transporters.


## [Is there evidence proving the efficacy of fish oil / EFAs / PUFAs / omega 3s for treatment of ADHD?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3e2t6v/i_am_neurobill_im_a_neuroscientist_who_had_worked/ctbzc4p)
*(Answered by an expert in Neurophysiology, Biophysics, and Neuropharmacology with ADHD in /r/AskScience.)*

>J Psychopharmacol. 2015 Jul;29(7):753-763. Epub 2015 Jun 3.  *Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation and cognition: A systematic review and meta-analysis.*  Cooper RE1, Tye C2, Kuntsi J2, Vassos E2, Asherson P2.
>
>BACKGROUND:  Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are promoted as cognitive enhancers with consumption recommended in the general population and those with neurocognitive deficits such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, evidence from randomised placebo-controlled trials is inconclusive.
>
>AIMS:  This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation on cognition in healthy populations and those with ADHD and related disorders (RDs).
>
>METHODS:  Databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults and school-aged children (who were healthy and typically developing (TD) or had ADHD or a related-neurodevelopmental disorder (ADHD+RD) which assessed the effects of n-3 PUFA on cognition.
>
>RESULTS:  **In the 24 included studies n-3 PUFA supplementation, in the whole sample and the TD and ADHD+RD subgroup, did not show improvements in any of the cognitive performance measures**. In those with low n-3 PUFA status, supplementation improved short-term memory.
>
>CONCLUSIONS:  There is marginal evidence that n-3 PUFA supplementation effects cognition in those who are n-3 PUFA deficient. However, there is no evidence of an effect in the general population or those with neurodevelopmental disorders. This has important implications given the widespread advertisement and consumption of n-3 PUFA; claims of cognitive benefit should be narrowed.


## [Do I need to worry about 'tolerance'?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3e2t6v/i_am_neurobill_im_a_neuroscientist_who_had_worked/ctb5jid)
*(Answered by a neuroscientist with ADHD in /r/AskScience.)*
>[P]eople with ADHD typically develop a tolerance which rapidly reduces side effects, but do not develop a tolerance to the therapeutic effects. When taken orally at normal doses, amphetamine and methylphenidate tend to continue to produce good therapeutic effects with minimal side effects.  The story becomes very different if you take bigger doses, or [use a non-approved method of intake].
>
>...[The] differences between people who take amphetamine for ADHD and people who take amphetamine recreationally are confounded by the fact that the regularity of dosing, the dose amount, and route of administration are probably different between those two groups. As I pointed out, the dose and dosing regimen make a huge difference in the effect of the drug.


## [If ADHD is 'complicated', why is medication prescribed so easily?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3e2t6v/i_am_neurobill_im_a_neuroscientist_who_had_worked/ctbbitn)  
*(Answered by a neuroscientist with ADHD in /r/AskScience.)*  
>If it were a matter of nothing but "being active and refusing to study," then perhaps, yes, it might seems excessive.  
>
>But in fact, ADHD is not something that is generally diagnosed quite so readily.  There is a difference between how the media sometimes portrays ADHD diagnosis (e.g. "they're just giving meds to any kid who won't sit still!") and the reality.   
>
>The reality is that ADHD is not overdiagnosed.  [1](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/10/67/), [2](http://jad.sagepub.com/content/11/2/106.full.pdf)


## Where can I get tested and/or receive help?

One of the most common places to receive testing and help via medication is through a Psychiatrist. Other Doctors may test and prescribe you medication but it is likely they will rather refer you to a psychiatrist for evaluation. A good place to start is by talking to your current doctor and see what he/she suggests, and ask them about psychiatrists in the local area.

## How much are psychiatric sessions?

This will be completely dependent on your region and can be any where from (-)$90-$300(+) each session. '''My personal experience''' was $230 for the first session which was an hour long and $90 for each session afterwards which was 30 minutes long. To start figuring out how you might be spending to see a psychiatrist you should either speak with your doctor about local practices or use Google to search your local area and call a few offices asking about the price of sessions. Do not be discouraged by the price information here, please go and look at your local area.

## Will my insurance cover my medication and/or psychiatric sessions?

This is a question you need to take to your insurance company, please call and ask them. We do not work for your insurance company and therefore do not know.

## Can I enlist in the MILITARY if I have ADHD?

Yes, but with conditions; They will not accept you if you are taking medication. The US military avoids enlisting anyone that requires daily medication. If you are currently taking medication you must stop for an entire year before enlisting. They might also restrict you depending on how severe your symptoms are.
